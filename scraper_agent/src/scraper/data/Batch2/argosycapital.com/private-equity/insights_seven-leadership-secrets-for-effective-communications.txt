Seven Leadership Secrets for Effective Communications

We’ve all heard the expression, “Communication is key.” But effectively conveying your brand message to your audience is harder than it sounds. So, how do you effectively communicate to build trust, earn loyalty and, ultimately, grow your business? Let’s take a look at the top communication techniques and strategies successful leaders use to engage and influence the community in and around their organization.

1. Show Who You Are

To start, develop an organizational framework, including a mission and vision, that resonates with all stakeholders. Be authentic – staff and customers alike should be able to naturally associate these defining statements with your business.

2. Be Clear and Concise

In order to be effective, business communications need to be easily digested and understood. Always strive to be clear and to the point in your communication, avoiding unnecessary details. Ensure that your message is easily understood and that it conveys the intended meaning.

3. Humanize Information

Distill complex data by using simple language and avoiding technical jargon that may not be easily understood by everyone. Instead of just reporting information, use storytelling to make it relatable and memorable. Incorporate metaphors and anecdotes to build understanding and make things actionable.

4. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat…

Repeat communications consistently across the appropriate channels to solidify understanding and importance. For customers, follow the Marketing Rule of 7, which states that your audience needs to be exposed to your message an average of seven times before they decide to act.

5. Listen Actively

A big part of effective communication is a leader’s ability to listen. Show that the conversation is reciprocal by proactively asking for opinions and ideas. Engage in active listening by making direct eye contact, eliminating distractions, and refraining from interruption. Silence cell phones and step away from your computer, so texts and emails don’t take your attention away. Take note of any feedback given to you, and use it constructively to improve your communication skills.

"Active listening is a two way street. Everyone appreciates being heard and one way to ensure someone feels heard is to engage with thoughtful clarifying and probing questions."

- Kirk Griswold, Co-Founder and Partner of Argosy Private Equity

6. Respect Your Audience

Always respect the intelligence of your colleagues, customers and stakeholders. Your audience is perceptive and can tell when you are not being straightforward. Avoid sugarcoating or shying away from difficult conversations. Be open and transparent when discussing hard things, and you will earn trust and build a loyal community.

7. Be Mindful of Cultural Differences

Different cultures have different communication styles, and it is essential to be mindful of these differences in business communications. Avoid making assumptions based on your culture and take the time to understand the communication styles of other cultures.

Realize Results

By consistently employing these business communication strategies, you will realize significant benefits and value, including:

Movement: influencing others to buy in and take action
Expression: more effectively saying what you mean and meaning what you say
Experience: creating memorable experiences that will keep customers coming back
Relationships: building meaningful, lasting relationships with internal and external stakeholders
Clarity: aligning your communications to your larger business strategy
Curiosity: asking questions to uncover the unknown
Intention: acting with social responsibility to do good or support a larger cause
Encouragement: providing support and a strong workplace culture for employees
Business Partner Takeaway

In order to be successful, great leaders know that effective communications are a critical part of any business’s strategy. But successfully imparting your brand message to internal and external stakeholders is no easy task. Hallmarks of skilled communicators are their ability to communicate clearly, listen actively and influence others. Implementing the above best practices will help you enhance communication in your organization, improving collaboration, productivity and overall success.
