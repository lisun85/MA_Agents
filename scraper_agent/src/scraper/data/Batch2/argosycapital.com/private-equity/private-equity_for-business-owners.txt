“Our family had been growing our business for over 25 years, it was not an easy decision to sell and we had to make sure we made the right choice. Argosy proved to be the right partner for us. With Argosy’s decades of experience and their toolkit of processes and best practices, I believe they were an excellent partner with tremendous support for us as managers and former owners. From the time of initial interest, through due diligence and all the way to exit, they handled our relationship with professionalism. We would absolutely partner with them again.”
