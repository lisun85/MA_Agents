Argosy Credit has extensive experience acquiring loans from commercial banks and other lending institutions. We understand the nuances and accept the risk associated with purchasing nonperforming loans of stressed or distressed businesses or properties.

We work quickly to simplify the loan sale process. Our team expresses its level of interest within days – then typically closes within three to four weeks following the receipt of all legal and financial information.
