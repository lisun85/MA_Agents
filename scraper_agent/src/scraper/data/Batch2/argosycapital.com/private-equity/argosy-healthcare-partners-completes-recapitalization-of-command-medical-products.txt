Argosy Healthcare Partners Completes Recapitalization of Command Medical Products

Argosy Healthcare Partners (“AHP”) announced today a recapitalization and partnership with Command Medical Products (“Command” or the “Company”). The Company provides contract manufacturing services for the production of single-use disposable medical devices to global medical device original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and life sciences customers. AHP is honored to partner with Command and support its next stage of growth.

Command Medical Products, headquartered in Ormond Beach, Florida, and founded in 1987 by David Slick, provides customized clean room manufacturing of single use medical devices leveraging key technologies including: tube extrusion, radio frequency (RF) welding, heat sealing and sterile barrier packaging. Command’s products serve critical end markets including cell & gene therapy, drug delivery, robot-assisted endoscopy, fluid management, and other high growth therapeutic areas. Command operates seven ISO Class 7 cleanrooms across two manufacturing locations in Florida and Central America.

Medical device and life sciences companies have increasingly turned to outsourced manufacturing to support the design and fabrication of their products. The trend is fueled by the requirements for accelerated time to market, cost-effective manufacturing, supply chain flexibility, and additional regulatory and compliance standards. Paul Barrett, Managing Partner of AHP, stated, “We thank David Slick for entrusting our team with his company. We are very excited to partner with Jim Carnall, Stephanie McGee, and the entire Command team. Command has a long and successful operating history, talented team, and blue-chip customer base. We look forward to fortifying the already strong foundation and reinvesting in the commercial engine to help accelerate growth.”

Jim Carnall commented, “We are proud to partner with AHP. Their investment in our company will allow Command to scale and better serve our customers. I am also thrilled that our entire leadership team will remain at Command while we work together with AHP to build out our next chapter of growth.”

This deal was facilitated and managed by MedWorld Advisors, a leading Middle Market M&A Advisory Firm specializing in MedTech, Med Device Manufacturing, and all things Healthcare based in the United States, with offices and partners around the world.
