"I have known Ken and Steve for nearly a decade.  My firm, Peninsula Capital Partners, first invested alongside Rock Gate in the acquisition of Walpar.  We continue to be impressed by Ken and Steve’s unwavering commitment to not only the long-term success of the business, but also to the personal success of every member of the Walpar team.  
Our belief in Rock Gate’s business principals and philosophy, has led us to invest with their team in several additional investments.  Each of these investments have performed well beyond our underwriting expectations. 
Peninsula has been backing investors and management teams in middle-market businesses for over 22 years, and Rock Gate is at the top of our list in terms of performance, capability, effort and their commitment to partnership."
