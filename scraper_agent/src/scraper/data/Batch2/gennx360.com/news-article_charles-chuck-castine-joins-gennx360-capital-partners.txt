Charles (Chuck) Castine Joins GenNx360 Capital Partners
Portfolio Company News - May 01, 2006

Chuck is a partner of GenNx360 Capital Partners. He brings over 30 years of experience in sales, business operations, and competitive strategy, specializing in leading businesses through market changes while improving both profitability and customer service.

Prior to joining GenNx, Chuck was the president of the Integrated Services Business for Alliant Energy Corp, a $3 billion electric & gas utility. Tasked with turning around and improving a deregulated business, Chuck achieved both profitability for his unit and an increase of over 25% in overall revenue growth.

Chuck spent almost 3 decades with General Electric serving in various sales, technology, and operating roles with increasing responsibility culminating in his promotion to corporate officer and the Vice President of the Consumer Service Division for the GE Appliance Business. There Chuck led a global business of more than 3,000 employees with over $500 million in yearly service revenue and warranty support for its worldwide operations. In restoring the service business delivery processes to compete profitably in highly competitive markets and revamping the overall appliance business focus from a manufacturing/complaint management culture to being driven by customer satisfaction, Chuck was able to drive over $25 million in annualized cost savings while at the same time increasing both margins, sales growth, and customer satisfaction.

Chuck earned his B.S. in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M University, where he was later inducted in its Academy of Distinguished Graduates In Mechanical Engineering and served on the University's Engineering Advisory board.
