GenNx360 Capital Partners’ Portfolio Company Tooling Tech Group Acquires Alpha Integration
Portfolio Company News - May 21, 2019

New York, New York.  May 21, 2019 - GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm investing in middle market business-to-business industrial manufacturing and business services companies, is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Tooling Tech Group (“TTG”), has completed the acquisition of Alpha Integration (“Alpha”) in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  The Alpha acquisition represents the fifth acquisition for Tooling Tech Group, since GenNx360’s investment in the platform in July 2014. 


Founded in 2002, Alpha Integration is experienced in the development and manufacture of assembly, material handling, dispensing, sorting, testing, welding, and fastening solutions for the automotive, cosmetic, electrical, construction and life sciences industries. The company will continue to operate out of its Murfreesboro location while its businesses practices will be integrated into the overall TTG operations.

“Alpha’s expertise in integrating a variety of processes into automated assembly and test solutions complements our existing capabilities and enhances our ability to serve our existing customers while enabling us to reach new markets, such as the medical and cosmetics sectors,” said Lee Childers, CEO of TTG. “This is a very exciting time of growth for our company.”
“I am very impressed with TTG, and I look forward to working with its leadership team to further support our current and potential new customers,” said Matthew Phillips, president of Alpha. “Partnering with TTG provides us more flexibility with increased resources and capacity, as well as a wealth of industry knowledge.”


This is the fourth acquisition by TTG since 2018. The company has grown both organically and through acquisition to become the largest tooling provider in the United States. Tooling Tech Group employs approximately 600 people with a total of 13 locations across five states including Ohio, Missouri, Georgia, Tennessee and Michigan.
