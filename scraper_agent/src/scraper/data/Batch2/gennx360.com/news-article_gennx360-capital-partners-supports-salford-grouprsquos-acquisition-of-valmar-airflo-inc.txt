GenNx360 Capital Partners Supports Salford Group’s Acquisition of Valmar Airflo, Inc.
Portfolio Company News - May 11, 2015

The Salford Group ("Salford"), a portfolio company of GenNx360 Capital Partners, acquired Valmar Airflo, Inc. (“Valmar”) based in Elie, Manitoba on May 4, 2015.

The Valmar acquisition adds significant benefits and expertise to Salford, with an expanded product line that now includes: primary, secondary, and vertical tillage, air seeders, commodity carts, cover crop seeders, spinner-type fertilizer spreaders, air-boom applicators and granular applicators for fertilizer, insecticide, seed, seed inoculant and forage preservatives.

“We are thrilled to add Valmar to our family,” stated Geof Gray, Chief Executive Officer of Salford. “This merger will allow us to offer a complete line of high quality seeding and granular application equipment to the grower and service provider.”  Gray also noted that he looked forward to seeing the combined strength and resulting synergies of the design teams at Valmar Airflo, BBI Spreaders and the Salford Air Cart division, as farmers would benefit from greater choice and fresh innovation.

Since 2007, interest in cover crop seeding among the farming community has expanded rapidly, and in response, Salford and Valmar have been steadily increasing their level of cooperation in order to offer farmers a flexible, effective cover crop application tool.

“This next step in our cooperation with Salford is very exciting for us,” said Mercedes Caron, Valmar President. “Salford has the capital, additional core expertise and access to markets that will bring Valmar’s existing product lines to more farms in North America and a greater global market.”

"This acquisition, the second add-on completed since our investment in Salford, further strengthens the GenNx360 agricultural investment platform as Salford continues to extend its footprint and market presence through product and geographic expansion," said Matt Guenther, the GenNx360 Partner who led the transaction.
