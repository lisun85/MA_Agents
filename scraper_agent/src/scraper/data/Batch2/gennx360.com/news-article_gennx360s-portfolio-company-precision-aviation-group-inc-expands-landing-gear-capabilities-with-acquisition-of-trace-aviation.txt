New York, New York.  August 11, 2021 - GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”) is pleased to announce its portfolio company, Precision Aviation Group, Inc.

Not only will we be able to significantly expand our product and service offerings to our existing customers by having access to PAG’s $50M rotable inventory, but we are excited to expand our MRO capabilities in the coming months.
