 “We’re very proud of what management and GenNx360 have accomplished.  The ARS investment represents a great example of our core capabilities including proven proactive sourcing, driving growth and profitability through operational and commercial enhancements, and building industry leading companies,” said Monty Yort, the GenNx360 Managing Partner who led the transaction.
 
“I am very pleased with the team we have built and, together, we have established ARS as a highly attractive, strategic participant in the rail sector.  We have enjoyed a strong working relationship with GenNx360, and they have been an outstanding partner in supporting our transformation of ARS,” said Scott Driggers, Chief Executive Officer of ARS. 
 
“We acknowledge the effort and resources GenNx360 contributed to ARS and are excited to integrate the Company and team in to Cathcart. We are looking forward to building upon the strong platform that GenNx360 helped create,” said Casey Cathcart, Executive Chairman of Cathcart.
