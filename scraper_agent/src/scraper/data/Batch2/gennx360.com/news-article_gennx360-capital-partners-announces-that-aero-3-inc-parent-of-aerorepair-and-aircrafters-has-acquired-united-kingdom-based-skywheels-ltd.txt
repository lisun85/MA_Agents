GenNx360 Capital Partners Announces that Aero 3, Inc., Parent of AeroRepair and Aircrafters, Has Acquired United Kingdom based Skywheels, Ltd.
Portfolio Company News - November 14, 2023
New York, NY. November 14, 2023. GenNx360 Capital Partners is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Aero 3, Inc. (“Aero 3”), has acquired Skywheels, Ltd. (“Skywheels” or “the Company”). Headquartered in Cheshire, England, Skywheels is a provider of wheel and brake repair and overhaul services for the global aviation industry. Founded in 1996, Skywheels services all aircraft types and OEM systems, and focuses on the UK and European markets.
 
Skywheels will become part of Aero 3, consisting of AeroRepair, Aircrafters and Hemico. The AeroRepair companies provide full-service aircraft wheel, brake, battery and landing gear repair and overhaul services for the commercial, corporate and general aviation industry. Aircrafters is an aftermarket distributor of Collins wheel and brake material and maintains an extensive parts inventory and rotable exchange pool to service the global aircraft market. Skywheels will join Aero 3’s ten (10) North American locations and become the platform to further expand Aero 3’s presence in the UK and EMEA markets.  
 
“We are excited that Aero 3 has selected Skywheels to be their UK and European partner. Skywheels is an established and respected provider of comparable services and will be a perfect launch pad for Aero 3. Our management teams have been familiar with one another for many years and share a similar culture and goal to be the premier service provider in our respective markets,” said Neil Morris, co-owner of Skywheels. Mr. Morris added, “The collective services offered by the combined entities and global reach will be of great value to their growing customer base.”
 
“Our Aircrafters division has grown exponentially in the UK and our acquisition of Skywheels demonstrates our intention to provide the same comprehensive array of services in the UK and Europe that we provide in North America. Our UK and European customers can now streamline their supply chain by utilizing a single source for their wheel and brake parts, repair and overhaul and exchange pool needs. We are excited to welcome Skywheels’ leadership and skilled technicians to our growing global family,” added Daniel Bell, Chief Executive Officer and President of Aero 3.
 
Daphne Dufresne, the GenNx360 Managing Partner who leads the Aero 3 investment said, "We are pleased to assist the Aero 3 team on its continued positive growth trajectory. The Skywheels acquisition is highly strategic. We are excited about the expansion of Aero 3 into the UK which will enable us to better serve our global customer base."
