Portfolio Company News - April 03, 2018

GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm which invests in middle market business services and industrial companies is pleased to announce the successful closing of its acquisition of Subsea Global Solutions  (“Subsea” or “the Company”), effective March 29, 2018. Subsea is a provider of underwater vessel maintenance, inspection and repair services to vessel owners and operators within diversified marine transportation and construction sectors.  Subsea services include hull and propeller fleet management, underwater wet welding, seal replacement, tunnel thruster repair, azimuth thruster repair, and environmental hull cleaning.  The Company provides both routine hull maintenance services to drive fuel efficiencies and highly technical repair solutions allowing vessel operators to reduce dry-docking costs, while keeping the vessel in service.  The Company is headquartered in Miami, Florida, and operates out of 12 facilities worldwide.  Subsea was previously owned by Lariat Partners, a Denver-based private equity firm, and Subsea Management. 
 
“GenNx360 is pleased to make this investment in Subsea,” said Matt Guenther, the GenNx360 Managing Partner who led the transaction.  “Subsea is a world-class organization that is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for innovative underwater maintenance and repair techniques and services. We look forward to working with Subsea’s strong, experienced management team to broaden its offerings through organic growth and strategic add-on acquisitions and expand its geographic reach, both in the U.S. and abroad.”
Paul Peters, CEO and President of Subsea, said, “We chose GenNx360 as our partner as we believe they are uniquely capable of supporting the Company’s continued growth in existing and new markets. The Subsea team is excited to partner with GenNx360 in continuing to build the company to the next level.”
