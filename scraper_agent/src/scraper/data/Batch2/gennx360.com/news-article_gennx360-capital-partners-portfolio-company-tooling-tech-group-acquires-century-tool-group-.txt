Portfolio Company News - April 18, 2018

New York, New York.  April 18, 2018 - GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm investing in middle market business-to-business industrial and business services companies, is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Tooling Tech Group (“TTG”), has completed the acquisition of Century Tool Group (“CTG”), which includes both Century Tool & Gage in Fenton, Michigan, and CTG Bel-Kur Automation in Temperance, Michigan.  This is the third acquisition for Tooling Tech Group since GenNx360 invested in the platform in July 2014. 


Century Tool Group is a multi-faceted engineering and manufacturing company, providing fully machined, precision compression molds, automation equipment, and secondary fixtures to North American automotive and heavy-truck OEM’s and Tier 1 suppliers.   Under the Century Tool & Gage name, the company provides medium to large compression molds for automotive and heavy-truck structural and Class-A exterior components.  CTG Bel-Kur, Century’s Automation division, provides automated assembly equipment and fixtures for downstream compression molding operations, ranging from simple manually operated machines to fully automated work-cells. 

“Century Tool is a world-class company that fits perfectly with our ‘whatever it takes, on-time, every-time’ operating model,” said Tony Seger, CEO of TTG. “We are excited to partner with them as TTG enters its next phase of growth.  This acquisition presents an opportunity for us to expand our already strong position in the automotive, heavy-truck and automation industries.”
