GenNx360 Capital Partners Announces Subsea Global Solutions Expands Its Worldwide Ports with Acquisitions of Underwater Contractors Pte. Ltd. and Gray Diving Services Pty. Ltd.
Portfolio Company News - January 01, 2020


New York, New York.  January 1, 2020 - GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm, is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Subsea Global Solutions (“SGS”), a leading global commercial diving company, has acquired Underwater Contractors Pte. (“UWC”) Ltd. In Singapore and Gray Diving Services Pty. (“GDS”) Ltd. in Australia. These transactions mark the second and third acquisitions for Subsea Global Solutions since GenNx360’s investment in the company in March 2018. 
 
Founded 40 years ago in Singapore, Underwater Contractors Pte. Ltd. specializes in commercial diving and marine-related services primarily to the commercial shipping industry.  Gray Diving Services Pty., originally formed in 1945, serves the marine and sub-marine construction industry based in Botany Bay, Sydney Australia.

Commenting on the acquisitions, Paul Peters, CEO of Subsea Global Solutions said; “This is a significant milestone in the history of Subsea Global Solutions. We are absolutely delighted to expand our global footprint to Singapore, a strategic commercial shipping hub where most of our clients visit regularly, as well as to Sydney, a critical port for our cruise business. With well-known brands like UWC and GDS joining our organization, we will solidify our leadership in our market segment and will be able to truly support our clients from these key locations with our own personnel, boats, gear, and equipment. We look forward to joining our forces.”
