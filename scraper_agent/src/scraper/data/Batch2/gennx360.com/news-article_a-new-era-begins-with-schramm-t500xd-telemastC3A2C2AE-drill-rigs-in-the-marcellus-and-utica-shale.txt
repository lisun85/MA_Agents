A New Era Begins with Schramm T500xd TelemastÂ® Drill Rigs in the Marcellus and Utica Shale
Portfolio Company News - March 19, 2013

Our new walking, talking Schramm T500XD Telemast® drill rig rated 500,000 lb. hook load is on its way to the Marcellus and Utica Shale in a compact eight truckload package. This rig sets a new standard with full 360 degree walking portability for fast moves from hole to hole without the traditional limits of two axis pad mounted designs.

The T500XD also talks by offering full communication interface connectivity to third party data acquisition providers that utilize the internet or dedicated satellite communications systems to remote operation centers in multiple locations.

Specifically designed for horizontal and directional drilling to a total depth of 15,000 ft. or more, the Schramm T500XD can precisely control weight on bit without relying on drill collars and gross string weight alone.

It offers best in class 35,000 ft-lbs of top head torque, third party directional steering interface and 80,000 lbs. of hydraulic pulldown capacity to take full advantage of expanding shale play opportunities worldwide.

Extending Schramm's leadership role in pipe handling automation, this rig includes an integral LoadSafe® XD system that can handle 24 inch diameter Range III tubulars weighing up to 10,000 lbs. Drill pipe is racked in the horizontal position for easy loading and offloading, dramatically improving operator safety. With over a decade of proven reliability and more than 200 Schramm patented Telemast® rigs in operation around the world today, our next generation T500XD Telemast® rig offers a highly portable,innovative solution to drilling contractors and E&P firms that demand the highest levels of safety and productivity with minimal environmental impact.
