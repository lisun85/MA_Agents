Portfolio Company News - October 04, 2022
New York, New York.  October 4, 2022 – GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”) is pleased to announce Aero 3, Inc., the parent company of AeroRepair, has acquired Aircrafters, Inc. (“Aircrafters” or “the Company”). Headquartered in New Castle, Delaware, Aircrafters is a leading provider of wheel and brake parts for the aviation industry through its aftermarket distribution of Collins wheel and brake parts, its extensive parts inventory, and the provision of exchange asset pools for multiple global operators. Founded in 1984, the Company has built a strong international reputation for its broad range of in-stock wheel and brake components and assemblies, Collins’ distribution and 24/7 AOG services. Going forward, the current management team will remain in place. The Company will join the Aero 3, Inc. family of companies consisting of AeroRepair Corp, Hemico, Inc. and AeroRepair Canada, Inc. The Aero 3 Inc. companies provide vertically integrated full-service aviation wheel, brake, battery and landing gear repair and overhaul services for the commercial, corporate and general aviation industry. Aircrafters’ Delaware facility, together with Aero 3, Inc.’s nine (9) North American locations, strengthen the company’s owned and operated logistics network and will further leverage the company’s machine shop and PMA/DER engineering capabilities.
 
“We are excited to join the industry’s leading North American provider of wheel and brake repair and overhaul services. We have worked closely with the AeroRepair team for many years and know that together we will accelerate our global growth ambitions,” said James Hicks, Aircrafters’ owner and President.  Mr. Hicks also added that “AeroRepair’s strong management team, impressive growth and market presence compliments Aircrafters’ extensive parts inventory and Collins’ parts distribution.  Together, we will provide a one-stop shop for our customers’ wheel and brake needs.”
 
“This is an investment we have targeted for some time as Aero 3, Inc., seeks to provide additional value-add services in an increasingly cost sensitive and competitive environment. Our ability to access parts through Aircrafters’ global network and Collins’ distribution will facilitate our North American expansion as well as increase our presence in Europe and other parts of the globe. We are excited to welcome Aircrafters’ dedicated team to the Aero 3 family,” added Daniel Bell, Chief Executive Officer and President of Aero 3, Inc.
Daphne Dufresne, the GenNx360 Managing Partner who leads the Aero 3, Inc. investment said, “This is a transformative acquisition that meaningfully strengthens our market presence. The Aircrafters acquisition is our third acquisition under GenNx360’s ownership and is a testament to the team’s ability to continue executing on one of our growth strategies to build our parts distribution capabilities.”
