Portfolio Company News - December 21, 2013

GenNx360 Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on investing in middle market industrial business-to-business companies, has acquired Salford Farm Machinery Ltd. ("Salford") for an undisclosed amount.

Salford is a Canada based leading manufacturer of tillage, seeding and fertilizing equipment for the global marketplace. Salford currently serves the North American and European markets from its facilities in Ontario, Canada, Iowa in the U.S., and through a joint venture in Omsk, Russia. The Company sells through more than 300 dealers and distributors in North America.

With a 30+ year operating history, the Company's brand has become synonymous with its reputation for innovation and superior product performance. Durable and highly engineered, Salford's patented tillage products offer the highest performance in all conditions, leading to increased farmer profitability. Salford's R&D team has driven continuous innovation in product development over the years, with the latest 'Independent Series' tillage products continuing to exceed farmer expectations.

"At GenNx360, we strongly believe in the megatrends that drive agribusiness. Tillage equipment manufacturers stand to benefit from the need for higher farm productivity and crop yields," says Matt Guenther, a Partner with GenNx360. "We believe Salford, with its strong brand, patented technology and established dealer network, is well positioned to benefit from the growth in the tillage market. We expect to build on Salford's strengths by leveraging our operational expertise and executing on identified growth opportunities, both organically and through add-on acquisitions."

"We are excited to partner with GenNx360 in our next stage of growth," said Geof Gray, Salford's President. "We are certain that GenNx360's value creation tools and the operational capabilities of its partners will help us in getting to our goals faster and more efficiently."
