NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- ERC (Enhanced Resource Centers), an international business process outsourcing (BPO) company, has partnered with DailyPay to provide access to on-demand pay to its U.S.-based employees. Through this partnership, ERC employees have the power of choice and control over their earned income.

Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, ERC has over 7,000 employees globally spread primarily across three U.S. locations in Florida and Georgia. Currently, 51 percent of ERC's U.S. employees have signed up for DailyPay. Employee transfers are used for immediate expense needs like utilities, credit card payments, food, gas, or transportation costs.

"We quickly recognized that DailyPay offered a solution to meet a need of our employees, allowing them to access their pay quickly," said Sam Rehm, Chief Financial Officer at ERC. "We immediately saw DailyPay as a potential bonus — not just to meet our employees' financial needs, but also that it could potentially deliver an extra star on the chart in recruiting and retention."
DailyPay is a solution that gives workers access to their pay as they earn it by safely and securely transferring a portion of their earned pay to an account of their choice, a debit card or a pay card. Since implementing DailyPay, ERC has experienced a 36 percent lower attrition rate for employees who use the benefit — a dramatic saving in expenses associated with hiring for the company.

"ERC is a prime example of our win-win service model," said Jeanniey Walden, Chief Innovation and Marketing Officer at DailyPay. "ERC is seeing longer retention rates and having a significantly easier time hiring talent while their employees are utilizing a benefit that allows them to be in control of their finances."
