BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- RLJ Equity Partners, LLC and Naylor Association Solutions today announced the acquisition of Fairfax, VA-based Timberlake Membership Software, a leading provider of management software solutions to associations and non-profit groups.

Launched in 1996, Timberlake delivers membership management software to 300 associations, providing streamlined technology and management of membership, event, and event related sponsor content to ensure comprehensive quality member customer support.

"RLJ Equity Partners is very excited to support Naylor Association Solutions' strategy to continue to expand the number of high quality products and services to its clients," said Jerry L. Johnson, Managing Director of RLJ Equity Partners.

"We are building a unique network of offerings that is designed to help associations improve the quality of their engagement with members and the industry they serve as well as generate vital non-dues revenue. Associations need a set of tools to manage member and industry data and help them fulfill their mission," explained Alex DeBarr, President and CEO of Naylor. "Member data is an association's most important and valuable asset. It is the connective tissue between the association, the membership and the dues and non-dues revenue that associations need to survive and prosper."

"We believe associations have never been better positioned to serve their members and industries—if they utilize the tools available to them and integrate them properly. Our job is to help build strong associations and Timberlake really expands our ability to do so," continued DeBarr.

"We are proud to form this strategic alliance with a company with such depth and experience in the association marketplace as Naylor," said Brian Choate, President and CEO, Timberlake. "Our clients will see immediate benefits through the investment in customer service, development and technology platform that are planned with the acquisition. Timberlake's association management software (AMS) and Naylor's full range of solutions creates endless possibilities for associations," concluded Mr. Choate.  

This transaction comes on the heels of Naylor's acquisition in April 2014 of Boxwood Technology, the leading job and career service provider for associations. Naylor's relationships with associations now include 1,000 print publications, 1,000 e-newsletters, online buyers guides, digital magazines and website sales projects; 1,000 career centers, managing 16 trade shows for associations and owning over 20 exchange/ appointment-based events via the Global Exchange Events business acquired in 2012. Naylor employs nearly 200 highly trained sales professionals who specialize in advertising, exhibit space, sponsorships and job postings that represent non-dues revenue for associations.

"This will be a great addition to the services we provide our associations," DeBarr continued. "Associations who manage their member data and communications activities effectively will also engage with their members more effectively and generate the most non-dues revenue. Technology has enabled the integration of communications, data, engagement and all association revenue," he concluded.

Timberlake will remain in its current Fairfax location, and will soon add customer and technical support positions in Naylor's Hunt Valley, MD location. Timberlake will become part of Naylor's soon-to-be announced consolidated Washington, DC-area office, which will also house Naylor's Event Solutions business (NaylorCMG) and Boxwood Career Solutions. With nearly 120 employees, the office is expected to open in the 3rd Quarter of 2015.  Naylor is headquartered in Gainesville, FL, with offices in Alpharetta, GA; Fairfax, VA; Darien, CT; and Winnipeg, Canada.

Naylor was acquired by Bethesda, MD-based private equity firm RLJ Equity Partners, LLC in December, 2013.
