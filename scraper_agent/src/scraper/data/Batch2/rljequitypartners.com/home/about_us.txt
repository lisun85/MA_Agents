Our Story

RLJ Equity Partners is a middle-market private equity firm focused on generating long-term capital appreciation by investing in profitable and growing businesses led by exceptional management teams. Founded in 2006 by Robert L. Johnson, RLJ invests in traditional buy-outs, recapitalizations, growth equity infusions, and add-on acquisitionsÂ 

RLJ primarily invests in North American companies with enterprise valuations between $25 million and $100 million. While our target investment size is between $10 million and $30 million per transaction, we have the ability to pursue larger transactions in collaboration with our strategic partners. We seek opportunities where we are able to partner with proven and motivated management teams to create value through a combination of strategic capital and operational insight
