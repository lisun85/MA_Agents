“Salesforce’s Intelligent Customer Success Platform empowers federal agencies to transform into more modern, responsive and intelligent organizations, enabling employees to connect with citizens in entirely new and powerful ways,” said Tyler Prince, Salesforce’s executive vice-president, World Wide Alliances and Go-to-Market Innovation. “With industry solutions, thousands of skilled Salesforce consultants and rapidly expanding capabilities, Accenture is a top strategic partner that empowers our mutual customers to digitally transform their businesses and succeed.”

With more than 11,000 Salesforce-skilled professionals and an ongoing investment in building deep Salesforce skills and leading capabilities, Accenture is unique in the Salesforce ecosystem.
