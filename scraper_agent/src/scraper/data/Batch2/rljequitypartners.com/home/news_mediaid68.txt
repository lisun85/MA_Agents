ALEXANDRIA, Va., Sept. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Phase One Consulting Group, LLC (www.pocg.com), today announced it has raised funding to strengthen its federal ecosystem and further accelerate the rate of modernization in the Federal IT sector, a roughly $80 billion market opportunity. Participating investors include Salesforce Ventures.

"There is an application layer revolution happening in the Federal sector, the likes of which have not been seen in 30 years. Massive O&M spending is forcing Agencies to re-think their fundamental application architecture decisions. Salesforce is the way of the future in Federal, as it enables incredibly fast modernization of legacy systems and provides significant cost savings over outdated legacy technologies," says Jerad Speigel, CEO of Phase One.

"The Salesforce ecosystem includes visionary consulting partners that play an integral role in bringing Salesforce innovation to life," said Dave Rey, executive vice president, North America public sector, Salesforce.
