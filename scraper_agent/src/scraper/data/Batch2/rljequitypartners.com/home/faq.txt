Won't Selling to Strategic Acquirer Maximize My Valuation?

Not always. It is true that often times strategic acquirers will pay more. However, unless you are looking to exit the company completely, this is not the best option. With a sale to a strategic acquirer, you will most likely become an employee and no longer be an owner/operator. More often than not, continuing to grow your business and getting a second or third bite at the apple could be the most lucrative option.
