Naylor Association Solutions, which provides integrated communications, event management, online learning, career services, association management software (AMS) and advertising, exhibit and sponsorship sales for the North American association marketplace, has acquired Schaumberg, Ill.-based WJ Weiser and Associates, a provider of association management solutions.

WJ Weiser services include everything from full outsourced management of associations to specific services such as accounting and financial management, branch and chapter management, and information and technology services.

“We are building a unique network of offerings that is designed to help associations improve the quality of their engagement with members, generate non-dues revenue and more than anything, succeed in their stated mission, “ said Alex DeBarr, president and CEO of Naylor.

He added, “Our job is to help build strong associations and WJ Weiser really expands our ability to do that.”

Wendy Weiser, president and CEO, WJ Weiser and Associates, said, “We are proud to be joining a company with such depth and experience in the association marketplace. I’m really excited to introduce the Naylor suite of products and services to our customers, and impressed with the Naylor and RLJ vision for growing the business.”

Jerry Johnson, an RLJ Equity Partners partner and chairman of Naylor’s Board, “We are particularly excited about the WJ Weiser targeted focus on medical and health sciences associations. Healthcare represents an important market sector for us and Weiser provides us with additional tools to offer the associations in it,” Johnson concluded.

Naylor and RLJ worked with NewStar Financial on the transaction.

Naylor acquired AMS supplier Timberlake Membership Solutions earlier this year and job board and career services provider Boxwood Technology in 2014.

In May 2015, Naylor acquired the exclusive North American distribution rights to Blue Sky Broadcast’s suite of online learning solutions.

In the past 12 months, Naylor also has introduced new video, content consulting, event consulting and an updated print/digital buyer’s guide offerings exclusively for trade and professional associations.
