Naylor Association Solutions has acquired Health eCareers’ nursing, allied and administrative business in a stock transaction that will magnify the recruiting abilities of employers and the employment options for members of its National Healthcare Career Network (NHCN). Naylor will assume ownership of key association contracts and work in close concert with Health eCareers to transition technology, associations and users in a seamless migration that enhances user experience and non-dues revenue generation.

“As owners of the Boxwood Job Board and the National Healthcare Career Network, Naylor has decades of expertise in the management and delivery of healthcare-centric career centers,” said Alex DeBarr, CEO of Naylor Association Solutions. “We are committed to continuing to provide the sharpest job board technology and excellent customer service to Health eCareers’ clients.”

“We strongly believe that Naylor provides the best business, technology and account management solution to ensure continuity for our valued association partners,” said Justin MacLean, Health eCareers’ managing director. “Their well-established healthcare career center network includes more than 300 associations supporting the recruitment advertising needs of thousands of hospital and ambulatory care facilities.

“Naylor shares our long-term commitment to the association community and was the natural choice when we considered the best possible outcome for our clients,” MacLean continued. “We are completely aligned in our goal for a smooth transition.”

As a result of its acquisition by Everyday Health, Inc., in December 2017, Health eCareers will focus exclusively on physicians/surgeons, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, leveraging the verified audience of these professionals that Everyday Health has built. As part of the Everyday Health Professional portfolio, Health eCareers now offers employers unprecedented reach to top talent by distributing their job listings to a network of more than 1 million physicians/surgeons, NPs and PAs, reaching 90 percent of all practicing providers in the U.S.
