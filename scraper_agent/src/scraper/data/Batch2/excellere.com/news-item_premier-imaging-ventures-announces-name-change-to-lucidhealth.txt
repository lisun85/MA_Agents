Premier Imaging Ventures Announces Name Change to LucidHealth

New brand reflects the organization’s evolution and vision for the future

COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ — Premier Imaging Ventures, a physician-owned and -led radiology management company, today announced its name change to LucidHealth.

“Our business has evolved significantly over the last several years, and our new name is more reflective of who we have become and where we are going as an organization,” said Marcia Flaherty, CEO of LucidHealth. “Today, we have the proven technology and talent to bring about real change in the radiology community, and our new brand reinforces the clarity we deliver to our physician partners about their future.”

The brand’s name change reflects LucidHealth’s vision for the future of radiology — one that will enable private radiology groups to do more and perform better. LucidHealth’s belief is simple: All patients should have access to the highest quality subspecialized imaging care, regardless of facility size or location. In keeping consistent with its vision and belief, LucidHealth’s mission is to empower physician-led radiology groups with the technology and resources necessary to deliver world-class, subspecialized care to all patients within the communities they serve.

Central to LucidHealth’s offering is superior technology. RadAssist is a proprietary application that allows disparate systems to be combined into a single workflow. This innovative software also manages diagnostic images across multiple platforms and enhances work processes for physicians. This increases efficiency, improves quality of care, lowers costs for patients and delivers better outcomes. RadAssist, built by radiologists, for radiologists, offers real-time clinical and operational analytics and has been in clinical use for over 10 years.

“Our technology allows radiologists to offer industry-leading turnaround times, exceptional subspecialized care and analytics that prove clinical value,” said Mark Alfonso, M.D., chief medical officer of LucidHealth. “LucidHealth consolidates our unique assets, allowing us to offer other groups cost-effective, revolutionary technology that elevates access to care.”
