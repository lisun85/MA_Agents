Biocare’s UltraLine – Ready to Use Antibodies for Roche Instruments

While every vendor strives to provide their customers with a product catalog that is as comprehensive as possible, the nature of IHC makes it impossible for everything to be offered by a single vendor. Therefore, instrument vendors allow customers to purchase empty reagent containers to program and load custom third-party reagents onto their instruments. For laboratories that run their IHC stains on the Roche BenchMark ULTRA, Biocare has developed the Ultraline, a specialized line of antibodies that have been optimized for the Roche/Ventana ultraView and OptiView detections.
