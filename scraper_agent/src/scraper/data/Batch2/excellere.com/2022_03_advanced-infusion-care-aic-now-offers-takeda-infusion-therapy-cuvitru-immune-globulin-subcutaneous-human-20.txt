Advanced Infusion Care (AIC) now offers Takeda infusion therapy Cuvitru™ [Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human)] 20%

Dallas, TX- Advanced Infusion Care, a division of AIS Healthcare, now offers Cuvitru™, developed by Takeda for the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI).

The nationally accredited home infusion teams at AIC collaborate closely with physicians to provide specialized in-home infusion services. This new therapy option, offered under a limited distribution partnership with Takeda, expands AIC’s ability to serve immunoglobulin (Ig) infusion patients.

“We’re proud to be able to add Cuvitru™ to our growing list of Ig infusion therapies,” said Jud Hall, President at AIC. “This new therapy from Takeda can help us provide additional treatment options for our PI patients.”

Cuvitru™ is indicated for the treatment of PI in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age or older. Approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration on September 14, 2016, the therapy is now available at all AIC locations.

Like all AIC patients, PI patients will receive a high level of care from AIC, including 24/7 access to clinical and support staff. Every patient is assigned a dedicated team of professionals, including clinical pharmacists, infusion nurse specialists, and intake managers to provide support throughout the treatment process.

For physicians, AIC is a full-service care delivery partner. We have contracts with multiple immunoglobulin suppliers, like Takeda. These contracts help us ensure prescribed therapies are always in stock. We also work directly with patients, insurance companies, and physician offices to secure all needed authorizations and complete paperwork.

AIS Healthcare is dually accredited by URAC and the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC).

Physicians interested in AIC care services should contact their AIC representatives to get started or visit us at www.aiscaregroup.com/our-divisions/infusion-care/
