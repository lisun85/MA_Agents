Excellere Partners Announces Its Investment in Two Labs Marketing

Denver, CO, January 10, 2017 – Excellere Partners, a Denver-based private equity firm focused on partnering with entrepreneurs and management teams, announced today that it has made a strategic investment in Two Labs Marketing, a leading provider of product commercialization solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers, offering strategic consulting and implementation services throughout the full product lifecycle. The Two Labs Marketing investment represents the tenth platform investment in Excellere Capital Fund II, L.P.

Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Powell, Oho, Two Labs Marketing provides innovative solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers’ most prevalent commercialization challenges. The company leverages more than 13 years of experience and over 115 discrete product launches to implement proven strategies that are customized to each client’s therapeutic class, distribution channel and patient needs. Through its comprehensive commercialization services offering, the company manages clients’ product launch, compendia and lifecycle management, trade management, product state licensing compliance and e-prescribing management services.

David Kessenich, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Excellere Partners, commented, “Our thesis in outsourced pharmaceutical services is based on a number of favorable industry trends, including the increased utilization of pharmaceuticals in patient treatment regimens, the sustained growth in specialty pharmaceuticals and the complexity associated with the distribution and administration of these therapies, and a continued trend toward outsourcing non-core functions among pharmaceutical manufacturers. Solutions providers, such as Two Labs, that act as strategic partners to pharmaceutical companies, and offer an exceptional customer value proposition are optimally positioned to benefit from these trends. We are thrilled to support Rich and his team as they continue to pursue their vision for growth.”

Rich Wartel, Founder and CEO of Two Labs, said, “A tremendous opportunity exists for Two Labs to further support our customers by enhancing our existing service capabilities, as well as strategically adding new solutions to the Two Labs portfolio. My team and I were in search of a partner that shared our vision for growth and could help us to achieve our goal of becoming the preeminent commercialization and lifecycle management partner for pharmaceutical manufacturers. We believe that we found such a partner in Excellere, which has substantial experience and resources within the outsourced pharma services industry and a proven track record of supporting management teams in growing healthcare businesses like ours.”

Together, Two Labs’ senior management and the Excellere team will seek to augment the company’s service portfolio through the development of additional value-added solutions, enhance the company’s proprietary technologies and tools, extend its geographic footprint, and expand its customer base through a targeted buy-and-build strategy.  Brad Cornell, Partner at Excellere Partners, said, “Two Labs is in a unique position to build upon its established brand reputation and recognized subject-matter- expertise to deliver more value to customers by adding complementary service capabilities and enhancing its existing solutions. We are excited to work with management to identify organic growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions that will allow Two Labs to solidify its position as the leading provider of commercial strategy and implementation services for pharmaceutical clients.”
