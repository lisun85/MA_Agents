Why The Breathing Triangle?

Have you ever heard of the term nasopharynx? How about oropharynx? We’re willing to bet you haven’t. Why? Because it’s clinical and it’s a part of your anatomy you don’t ever really think about.

You see, the nasopharynx is where the back of the throat meets the nasal cavity and the oropharynx is the space in the back of your throat, where it meets your oral cavity. This is the critical pathway that the air you breathe takes on its way to deliver oxygen to your lungs. It’s arguably one of the most important areas of the human body. And it, along with your nasal cavity, are likely the culprits for a lot of your sleep and sinus issues.

At ADVENT, it’s all that we focus on.

We singularly focus on this area so much that we call it by another name — one that is much easier to remember and understand. We call it The Breathing Triangle® — because each of the three points (the throat and each nostril) come together and form an upside-down triangle. Simple enough, right?

As ENT surgeons and specialists, we walk a fine line of not oversimplifying by lumping together the treatment of the ears, nose, and throat. They are all so intimately connected and intertwined, yet each is so intricate and deserves specified care. That’s exactly what ADVENT was founded on. Rather than being a jack of all trades, we focus on one area. By narrowing our focus on The Breathing Triangle® only, we can do it all by not doing it all — we can give more accurate diagnoses, deliver permanent solutions and provide much better results.

What’s Going On Inside Your Breathing Triangle

If your nose or throat is tight or not working as it should, you’re going to feel it. And if your nose isn’t working, your throat better be, because if it’s not, that’s a real problem. You’ll likely feel pretty miserable, both physically and mentally.

And it can make you feel pretty anxious if you have issues in one of these areas, or even both at the same time. If just one of the three legs of The Breathing Triangle® isn’t working properly, it’s trouble. Many folks actually have dealt with issues in these areas their whole lives, and have no idea how bad it really is until we diagnose it, treat it and fix it.

Your Breathing Issues: 1 of 2 Things…

When you have issues with your Breathing Triangle, and whether they show up with your sleep or your sinuses, it’s caused by one of two things. Either your anatomy inside your nose is too tight and restricted, or your lining is irritated and inflamed.

Typically, the ways this gets treated are nothing more than band-aid solutions. You’ve probably experienced this yourself: You’re prescribed a nasal spray and sent on your way with a hearty “good luck.” But you know, after dealing with the same pain and blockage over and over, that a nasal spray isn’t going to work for you. That’s because it’s attacking the symptoms, not treating the root cause that lies in your anatomy.

Here are some of the common signs that can show problems in The Breathing Triangle®:

Frequent sinus infections
Headaches 
Congestion or runny nose
Snoring and sleep apnea
Dry mouth and sore throat

The best approach for fixing any sinus-related issues is to ensure the anatomy is open and the lining inside of your nose is working properly. And nobody has that exclusive focus … other than ADVENT. In fact, that’s actually the reason for the creation of our practice. We wanted to give people the options, results, and peace of mind that we know they couldn’t find anywhere else. We can achieve long-lasting results through our specialized, in-office procedures like Balloon Sinuplasty (open things up), Turbinate Reduction (shrink obstructions), or Clarifix (freeze the leaky faucet).

In contrast, by receiving generalized care from the average primary physician, patients aren’t finding the success they deserve. There aren’t easy and accessible solutions anywhere else, but because focusing on this area is all we do, we have been able to deliver results that are truly changing people’s lives through our effective in-office procedures.

We know that more people will benefit from understanding what we do and what we don’t do. We are on a mission to change the way people approach their ENT issues. By coining this new term, we hope people will be able to identify for themselves “I have a Breathing Triangle issue” and with that, they’ll also know “ADVENT is the answer.”
