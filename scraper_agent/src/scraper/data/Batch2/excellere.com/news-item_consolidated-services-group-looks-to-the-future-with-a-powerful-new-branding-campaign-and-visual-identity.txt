Consolidated Services Group Looks to the Future with a Powerful New Branding Campaign and Visual Identity

Hamilton, NJ (February 6, 2018) Medical claims management innovator Consolidated Services Group (CSG) today introduced a new national brand identity designed to unify its brand and convey its industry-leading proficiency managing complex claims and exceptions.

Beginning on February 6, 2018, CSG will change its name to Medlogix®, which aligns the company’s corporate brand with its groundbreaking Medlogix® technology. The company also unveiled a new logo and introduced the tagline, “Expect exceptional,” as part of the brand refresh.

“We are proud of our CSG name and the distinguished brand it represented for over three decades. However, we made the strategic decision to evolve our brand identity to reflect the transformative growth and development our company is undertaking,” said President Craig Goldstein. “Medlogix® is a strong name that evokes smart medical decisions grounded in logic.  It enjoys significant brand recognition in our key markets and we believe that, paired with our new tagline and graphic style, it conveys the complexity of what we do in a positive, compelling way.”

Since announcing a major investment by the private equity firm Excellere Partners in June 2017, CSG has hired key senior managers, steadily expanded its team, and advanced its sales and service capabilities to support its continued growth.

“We consider this another in a series of great milestones for our company. Together with our strong industry reputation for achieving great outcomes in complex markets and rock solid client relationships, we believe a unified brand can help us leverage company awareness to attract top talent in markets across the United States,” Goldstein said. “The Medlogix® brand will propel us into the future with claims management professionals and solutions that consistently rise to the challenge of taking on the toughest cases and most difficult markets on behalf of our clients.”

As a medical claims management innovator, Medlogix® delivers a proven mix of technology and medical expertise that enables its clients to confidently navigate some of the most highly regulated markets with the largest exposures producing maximum returns. The company’s offerings include seamless collaboration through its proprietary Medlogix® technology; recommendations from highly qualified medical professionals; and access to a national network of premier health care providers. CSG’s national PPO network offerings will be marketed under MedlogixPPO™, with its flagship CHN PPO retaining its current brand.
