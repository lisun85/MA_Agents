Two Labs Acquires Pennside Partners Ltd.

Company continues to expand suite of solutions with addition of market insights, benchmarking and competitive intelligence services

DENVER, Colorado (October 25, 2018) – Industry-leading pharmaceutical services company, Two Labs, an Excellere Partners platform company, today announced it has acquired Pennside Partners Ltd., an international provider of market insights, benchmarking and competitive intelligence services for the pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device sectors. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

The partnership is a testament to the companies’ shared commitment to bettering patients’ quality of life through improving pharmaceutical product access. The companies’ combined subject-matter expertise, broad experience across therapeutic areas, and global reach creates a powerful combination that will allow Two Labs to provide enhanced services throughout the product lifecycle from pre-launch through loss of exclusivity.

In December 2016, Two Labs received a strategic investment from Excellere Partners, a Denver-based private equity firm focused on partnering with entrepreneurs and management teams in emerging growth companies. Since forming the partnership, Two Labs and Excellere have pursued a targeted buy-and-build strategy focused on enhancing the company’s service portfolio through developing and acquiring complementary, value-added solutions, extending its geographic footprint, and expanding its customer base. The acquisition of Pennside Partners marks the Company’s second strategic acquisition in 2018, following its acquisition of MKO Global Partners, a provider of pricing and managed markets services in February.

“In the highly competitive pharma market, it is crucial to stay at the forefront of the industry by providing unparalleled clinical product insights and strategic commercialization roadmaps,” said Rich Wartel, CEO of Two Labs. “This acquisition allows us to offer an even more comprehensive portfolio of integrated services to meet our clients’ evolving commercialization needs, giving them the ability to deliver transformative, life-saving products to patients across the globe.”

Brad Cornell, Partner at Excellere added, “The Two Labs leadership team has been laser-focused on adding complementary services that respond to the evolving needs of their biopharmaceutical clients, and the Pennside capabilities are a perfect fit with that strategy. Combined with the MKO Partners acquisition earlier in the year, Two Labs now has established a true global offering that can support its clients’ access challenges across the full product life cycle.”
