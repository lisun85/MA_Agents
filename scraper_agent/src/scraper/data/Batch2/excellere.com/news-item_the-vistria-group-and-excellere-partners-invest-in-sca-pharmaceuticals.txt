The Vistria Group and Excellere Partners Invest in SCA Pharmaceuticals

WINDSOR, CONN. (Jan. 19, 2021) – SCA Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“SCA Pharma”), has entered into a definitive membership interest purchase agreement with The Vistria Group (“Vistria”) and Excellere Partners (“Excellere”).

The Vistria Group and Excellere Partners have purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SCA Pharma. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

SCA Pharma, an FDA-registered outsourcing facility, serves over 1,200 hospitals and health systems in the United States. The company provides compounded drugs that are otherwise not commercially available, filling a critical void in the pharmaceutical drug landscape.

“We are very pleased that as we continue our expansion efforts and improvements in our efficiencies, our new partnership with The Vistria Group and Excellere will allow us to accelerate these efforts,” said Milton Boyer, CEO of SCA Pharma. “Both partners recognize the unprecedented growth that we have achieved and are committed to fast-tracking our expansion and automation goals.”

“As exemplified during today’s public health crisis, SCA Pharma plays a mission-critical role in the healthcare ecosystem by providing hospitals with a reliable source of safe, ready-to-use product. We look forward to working with Excellere to take the high standards set by SCA even further,” said Jon Maschmeyer, Partner at Vistria.

Recently, SCA Pharma announced plans to expand both of its sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Windsor, Connecticut, and Little Rock, Arkansas, after years of continued growth. The expansion will increase SCA Pharma’s physical footprint by more than 50 percent and introduce significant new automation to enhance scalability and continue to drive market-leading growth.

“We are tremendously excited to partner with Milton and the SCA Pharma team and believe SCA represents a unique opportunity to build the industry leader in the 503B space with an unsurpassed commitment to quality and operational excellence,” said Ryan Glaws, Managing Partner with Excellere.

An emerging national leader in compounded pharmaceuticals, SCA Pharma previously was wholly owned by Enhanced Healthcare Partners.

“We benefitted tremendously from our relationship with Enhanced and are grateful for their insights and supports,” Boyer added. “Our growth under their leadership has been phenomenal.”

The Leadership team will remain with SCA and Boyer will continue to serve in his current capacity as CEO. No changes are planned for the company’s daily operations.

William Blair & Company served as exclusive financial advisor and McDermott Will & Emery LLP served as legal counsel to SCA. Ropes & Gray LLP served as legal counsel to the buyers.
