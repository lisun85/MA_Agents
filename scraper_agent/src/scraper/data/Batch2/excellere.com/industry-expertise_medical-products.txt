INVESTING IN A SHARED VISION

Meeting the Challenges of Medical Products Operators

Excellere’s interest in the sector is motivated by the firm’s significant healthcare investment experience and its thesis behind the critical role Medical Products will play in the future of the healthcare ecosystem, including: (i) a continued focus on precision and personalized medicine – creating demand for new technologies that enhance diagnoses while lowering overall cost of care, (ii) a shift outside of traditional care settings (such as in-home and telemedicine) – driving demand for remote and tech-enabled solutions, (iii) increasing incidences of complex, [chronic] diseases and disorders – leading to demand for products that enhance therapy quality and utilization, and (iv) growing global healthcare expenditures due to an aging population, technological advancements and regulatory complexities.

AREAS OF INTEREST

Investment Focus

Achieving industry leadership does not always mean building the largest company, but it does mean building a company that is valued by its customers and admired by its competitors. We believe those traits can’t simply be purchased, which is why they must be inherent in every company we partner with. Excellere is actively seeking medical products investments across diagnostics, medical technology, and pharmacy supply chains where we have previous direct experience and domain expertise or have completed extensive industry research and developed a strategic vision for growth.

Medical Products & Outsourced Services

The Medical Product Manufacturing and Outsourcing industry plays a crucial role in the production and distribution of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and other healthcare related products through ensured product access, reliability, quality, packaging, and/or distribution. Many medical product manufacturers choose to outsource certain aspects of design, engineering, and/or manufacturing to access specialized capabilities and economies of scale to and focus on core competencies, like research and development.

The increasing propensity to outsource pre- and post-production processes coupled with the high switching costs of these services and products once they continues to drive outsized growth of contract manufacturing relative to OEMs. Particularly for providers with clear and focused strategies, targeted markets, differentiated engineering and manufacturing capabilities, and high quality programs and service.
