Strength Capital Portfolio Company, ARCH Global Precision, Announces the Sale of Hi-Vol Products

ARCH Global Precision, a Strength Capital Partners, LLC platform company, has sold its Hi-Vol Products subsidiary to LISI Automotive.  LISI Automotive is a subsidiary of LISI Group, a French public company focused on providing products to the aerospace, automotive and medical end markets.  

Hi-Vol manufacturers components for the automotive market.  With the sale of Hi-Vol, the ARCH platform will be repositioned to focus on three core markets; cutting tools, medical implants / instruments and high-precision components for aerospace and defense.  

Hi-Vol Products, along with Richard’s Micro Tool and KEO Cutters, was one of the three businesses that were brought together in 2011 to start the initial ARCH platform.  

Per Mark McCammon, one of the founding partners of Strength Capital; “We would like to express our sincerest gratitude to the members of the Hi-Vol team for their hard work and dedication to the ARCH platform over the past seven years.  While it is bittersweet to see one of the original ARCH businesses leave the platform, we believe they have a fantastic new partner in LISI and wish them the best of luck in the future”.
