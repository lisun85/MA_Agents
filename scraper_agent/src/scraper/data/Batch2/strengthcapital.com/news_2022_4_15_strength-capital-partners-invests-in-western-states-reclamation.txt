Strength Capital Partners Invests in Western States Reclamation

Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), a private investment company with offices in Birmingham, MI, Cincinnati, OH, and Denver, CO, is pleased to announce its recent investment in and partnership with Western States Reclamation (“WSR” or the “Company”). 

Headquartered in Frederick, CO, WSR is a leading provider of environmental and specialty civil contracting services with a focus on projects involving the preservation and protection of water resources.  The Company serves public and private customers located throughout the Western United States. 

Whether it’s stablizing a riverbank, relocating a water reservoir, or building a new city park, the Company prides itself in taking a scientific approach to delivering a wide variety of services to its customers.  The Company’s services include Reclamation & Restoration, Landscape & Irrigation, and Civil Contracting. Within its Reclamation & Restoration business, the Company is a market leader in aerial forest fire restoration projects which serve to protect critical watersheds in the Mountain West.  WSR’s extensive capabilities allow them to accommodate a wide range of project sizes and scopes. 

WSR was founded in 1983 by CEO David Chenoweth, a professional soil scientist and certified ecological restoration practitioner. David is supported by a highly experienced management team with 30 years of experience at the Company. 

Strength is excited to partner with David and the entire WSR team to continue to execute on the Company’s growth strategy. In addition to organic growth initiatives, the Company and Strength will seek to execute a “buy and build” strategy by selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions.    

Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included First Merchants Bank, Northcreek Mezzanine and Midwest Mezzanine. Jaffe Raitt Heuer & Weiss (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
