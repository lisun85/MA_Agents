DTM Distributors Announces the Acquisition of ACME Meat Company

DTM Distributors, Inc. (“DTM”), a portfolio company of Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), is pleased to announce the recent acquisition of ACME Meat Company (“ACME” or the “Company”). 

Headquartered in Phoenix, AZ, ACME is a leading specialty food distributor and processor serving independent Mexican restaurants throughout the state. From its Phoenix distribution center, the Company can supply its customers with high quality food at competitive prices within 24 hours of ordering. ACME’s core product offering focuses on “center of the plate” foods such as beef, pork, and poultry. In addition, the Company supplies Mexican restaurants with necessary ingredients such as cheese, produce, canned / dry goods, and tortilla chips. 

ACME Meat Company was established in 1989 but its roots date back to the 1950s as small meat processing business serving the local market. Today, daily operations are managed by Shalee “Stormy” Kraus, who has nearly 25 years of experience with ACME. DTM and Strength are excited to partner with Stormy and the entire ACME team to continue the Company’s history of providing high quality products and customer service.

Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included Signature Bank and Northcreek Mezzanine. Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
