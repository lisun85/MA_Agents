TITLE: Approach — Strength Capital

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
INDUSTRIAL CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY

We seek to grow and diversify our businesses via acquisition. The integration of several small, concentrated businesses into a large, diversified and resilient organization can create tremendous value. We have successfully executed this strategy in several portfolio companies, combining Strength Capital’s transaction and financial expertise with our management teams’ operating expertise.

BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS

We take pride in working effectively with others. We partner with our management teams, empowering and motivating them to achieve successful outcomes for all stakeholders. A solid partnership with management is absolutely necessary. This is particularly important when executing an Industrial Consolidation strategy as we lean on the management team to identify new opportunities.

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

We believe operational excellence is indispensable. The trains must run on time. We permit our management teams the autonomy to run their operations the way they see fit. We interject only where we are needed. We know what we don’t know. We seek management teams who are experts in operating their business.

INDUSTRY FOCUS & QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA

We invest in U.S. based businesses with $4 - $25 million in EBITDA. We specialize in manufacturing, distribution, infrastructure and industrial services. We also have experience in and an appreciation for financial services. We do not invest in technology, software, healthcare or other “speculative” spaces. We do not make minority investments.
