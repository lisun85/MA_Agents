Portfolio Sales

AccessSMT, a portfolio company of Speyside Equity, announces the sale of AccessSMT Wholesale Division. The transaction was completed on January 31, 2020.

AccessSMT, founded in 1964, has evolved into a leading manufacturer and value-added distributor of doors, frames, finishing hardware, construction specialty products, and access control devices in Western Canada and the US Pacific Northwest. The company primarily serves the mixed-use, multi-family residential market along with the industrial, commercial, and institutional (“ICI”) market segment.

”
The Wholesale Division was non-core to the primary AccessSMT platform and selling it was a strategic move to streamline the company and focus solely on the project management side of the business.

The Wholesale Division sold security solutions and door hardware including mechanical security devices, access control, exit hardware, safes, and other wholesale products operating across Canada to locksmiths and other industrial and commercial end markets.
