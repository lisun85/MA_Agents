Merger brings unmatched experience and expertise to the marketplace.

AccessSMT Holdings Ltd. (formerly Shanahan’s Limited Partnership and McGregor & Thompson Hardware Ltd.) and CP Distributors Ltd. are pleased to announce their merger to create a new leader in the North American door, hardware and specialties industry.

AccessSMT, founded in 1928, and CP Distributors, established in 1962, are proud to merge their legacies to build a stronger future. Together, they bring unmatched experience and expertise to the marketplace.

CEO, Mike Barnes explains, “By merging, we leverage the shared values, strengths and synergies of both organizations, positioning us to deliver even greater value to our stakeholders. This strategic decision was fostered through years of mutual respect and careful consideration, recognizing that our combined force would be far greater than our separate entities.”

The unified team now spans 17 strategic locations nationwide, gearing up to deliver excellence and drive innovation. “Our customers, vendors and employees remain at the heart of what we do and how we do it. We look forward to broadening our offerings to our customers, strengthening our valued partnerships with our vendors, and further investing in the development and career opportunities of our employees,” says Mike Barnes.

Currently, all contact information for AccessSMT and CP Distributors, including phone numbers, email addresses, and building addresses will remain the same; customers and vendors will be notified when changes are made. All documents, invoices, shipping documents, product packaging etc. will remain under current arrangements until notified otherwise.
