About Us.
Transforming underperforming businesses into well-run organizations.

Speyside Equity makes control investments in middle-market businesses with histories of profitability. Targeted portfolio companies often possess balance-sheet, legal, environmental, labor, or transactional complexity causing financial or operational stress.

Speyside Equity focuses on creative transaction structures. We are comfortable investing in carve-outs of large multinational companies, industry consolidations, family-owned businesses, bankruptcies and work-outs, and other special situations. Target investments typically have revenues of up to $500 million, but we can exceed that range on a case-by-case basis.

Our senior investment team members have extensive transactional, operations, and turnaround experience from their roles at Speyside and prior positions.
