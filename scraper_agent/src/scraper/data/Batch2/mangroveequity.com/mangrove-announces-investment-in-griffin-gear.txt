Mangrove Announces Investment in Griffin Gear

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce its investment in Griffin Gear, LLC, a South Carolina-based leading provider of industrial gearbox repair and rebuild services and aftermarket replacement gears.

Founded in 1967 by Joe Griffin as an offshoot of the family’s foundry business, Griffin Gear has evolved into a leading provider of best-in-class industrial gearbox repair services and aftermarket replacement gears. With over 50 years in operation, Griffin has developed extensive expertise working with virtually all major OEM gearboxes across a variety of industrial applications. Today, Griffin is one of the few companies in the U.S. with the engineering skills, personnel, equipment and tooling required in to operate in the large gear market, a highly specialized segment of the gear industry. Serving a highly diverse set of blue-chip industrial customers, Griffin Gear helps manufacturers avoid the negative effects of machine downtime, which include lost production, cost overruns, plant disruption, scheduling delays and customer dissatisfaction.

Griffin Gear’s senior management team will continue leading the business alongside Mangrove. “Our partnership with Mangrove marks an exciting new chapter for Griffin,” said President Randy Stewart. “Over the past 40 years, it has been incredibly rewarding to be a part of the Griffin Gear story. The success we’ve seen reflects our team’s hard work and commitment, along with the trust and loyalty of our valued customers. We look forward to collaborating with Mangrove to leverage their operational expertise and drive continued growth.”

Mangrove and Griffin Gear are seeking to invest in additional gear manufacturing and gearbox repair businesses with revenues from $2 million to $50 million.
