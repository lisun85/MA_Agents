Mangrove is Pleased to Announce Another Opportunity to Build Value: Readylift.com

Mangrove recently partnered with the Founder and management team of ReadyLIFT to effect a majority recapitalization of this leading designer and manufacturer of high-quality leveling and suspension kits for off-road enthusiasts in the automotive aftermarket. ReadyLIFT manufactures products for trucks and SUVs across numerous OEM brands including Ford, GMC, Dodge, Chevy, Toyota and Jeep.

Mangrove was attracted to ReadyLIFT because of its dominant brand position, its talented team, and ReadyLIFT’s history of creating high-quality lift products. The Mangrove team has enjoyed considerable successes in the auto aftermarket and with other enthusiast-driven consumer product companies. We are excited to continue that success with ReadyLIFT.

Mangrove’s internal operating team will work collaboratively with the folks at ReadyLIFT to optimize operating efficiency, profitability, and growth, while preserving ReadyLIFT’s outstanding commitment to quality and the satisfaction of its customers.
