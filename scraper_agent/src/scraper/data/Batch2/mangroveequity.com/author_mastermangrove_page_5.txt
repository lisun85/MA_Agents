PPS Makes Second Investment in U.S. Contract Security Industry with Acquisition of AHPS

Posted September 26th, 2019 by Mangrove Equity Partners & filed under Portfolio News.

Patrol Protect and Secure, Inc. (known as “PPS”) is pleased to announce its second investment in the U.S. contract security industry with the acquisition of American Heritage Protection Services (“AHPS”). AHPS is an Illinois based quality provider of armed and unarmed security guard services, primarily to utility companies and healthcare facilities. This addition and other initiatives have tripled the profits of PPS in the 9 months since our initial investment. The acquisition of AHPS is complementary to PPS’ existing operations and adds size, scale, and diversity to the platform.
