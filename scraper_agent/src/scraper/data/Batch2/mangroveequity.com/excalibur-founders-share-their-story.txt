Excalibur Crossbow Founders Share Their Story!

Mangrove had the pleasure of partnering with Bill and Kath Troubridge from Excalibur Crossbow, a designer and manufacturer of high end hunting crossbows and accessories.

They were seeking a partner who could provide them with liquidity and, more importantly, provide them with the operational support they needed to grow the company.

In this video, Bill and Kath share their thoughts on their partnership with Mangrove and what we were able to accomplish together.

A detailed case study of how Mangrove helped to build meaningful value with Excalibur is also provided here.

We are excited to share their story.
