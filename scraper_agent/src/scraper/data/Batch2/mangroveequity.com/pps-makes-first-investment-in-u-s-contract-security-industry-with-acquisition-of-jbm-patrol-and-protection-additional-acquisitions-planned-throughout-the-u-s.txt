PPS Makes First Investment in U.S. Contract Security Industry with Acquisition of JBM Patrol and Protection Additional Acquisitions Planned Throughout the U.S.

Patrol Protect Secure, Inc. (known as “PPS”) is pleased to announce its first investment in the U.S. contract security industry with the acquisition of JBM Patrol and Protection, Corp., a leading provider of contract security services in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Tennessee with a focus on contract guard services and vehicle patrol for a wide range of commercial clients.


March 13, 2019 –  Jim Mankowski, JBM Patrol and Protection’s founder, sought a transaction to facilitate his retirement, and PPS was an uncommonly strong fit – PPS facilitated Jim’s retirement while preserving his legacy of service excellence, providing for the ongoing success of the business he built and keeping his impressive team intact.

PPS was formed by Mangrove Equity Partners and Sunlake Capital to pursue a growth-oriented investment strategy in the U.S. contract security industry.  We believe there is tremendous opportunity to build a substantial, best-in-class contract security provider by focusing on service excellence and recruiting, training and retaining high quality people – thus filling a void left in the market as the large contract security firms increasingly sacrifice quality for volume.

PPS is actively seeking acquisitions of like-minded contract security providers to support its growth in new and existing geographies.
