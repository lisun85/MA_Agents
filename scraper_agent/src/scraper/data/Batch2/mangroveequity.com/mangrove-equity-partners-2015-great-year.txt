Mangrove – 2015 A Great Year

2015: A Great Year

An NFL team narrowly missed a perfect season (congrats friends in Charlotte).
Presidential debates became the latest version of reality TV (to entertain and horrify).
Mangrove Equity Partners closed six highly attractive acquisitions in spite of a very competitive environment.

In 2015, the Mangrove team was pleased to partner with three new platform companies and their management teams while supporting existing portfolio companies through three add-on acquisitions.

These transactions reflected Mangrove’s geographic reach throughout the U.S. and Canada; we completed deals in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Denver, and Las Vegas. In some cases, the add-ons were as large as their respective platform companies.

For one portfolio company, the strategically attractive add-ons we completed more than tripled their profits and created meaningful value for all shareholders.

The Mangrove team has a long history of successfully executing buy-and-build strategies. Our internal operating team is uncommonly adept at integrating add-ons to capitalize on value-creation opportunities and effectively managing the complexities of combining companies.

Mangrove’s 2015 Platform Investments

ReadyLIFT – a manufacturer of leveling and lift kits for the automotive aftermarket (Mangrove has a long history of success in this sector and in other enthusiast-driven branded consumer niches).

Computer Aided Technology – one of the largest value-added resellers of Dassault Systems/ SolidWorks 3D computer aided design and 3D simulation software, as well as Stratasys 3D printers.

Dixie Diamond Manufacturing – the nation’s largest domestically-owned manufacturer of synthetic-diamond-tipped concrete and asphalt cutting tools.

We enter 2016 with two additional closings in the works.

As in prior years, we look forward to building value with our portfolio partners and to working closely with you. We remain profoundly grateful for your continued interest and support.

Mangrove strives to be your first choice for majority recapitalizations, management buy-outs, management buy-ins, divisional acquisitions, and recap/industry consolidations with private companies earning $2mm to $10mm of EBITDA throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Heart-felt wishes for a very enjoyable and productive 2016!
