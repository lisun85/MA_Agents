Recapitalization of Everett Laboratories, Inc.
Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the recapitalization of Everett Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey based developer and marketer of specialty, prescription nutraceuticals.

Mangrove recently partnered with the daughter and son-in law of the founder of Everett Laboratories, Inc. to affect a majority family recapitalization of this leading developer and marketer of patented, prescription nutraceutical products. Everett’s innovative products include more palatable and tolerable prenatal vitamins and other nutritional support products for patients in various health states. The transaction provided liquidity for the retiring founder, while affording his family members meaningful retained ownership, continued roles as the leaders of the company, and an ideal partner to support future growth.

Like many company owners and intermediaries, the family and their broker chose us as their partner because Mangrove provided more than just money by:

Capitalizing on an existing strategic relationship with a thought leader in the industry who now sits on Everett’s board, and serves as a corporate development officer of the company. This was highly valued by the company owners and operators
Bringing to bear the captive resource of Mangrove’s three full time operating partners who will work with management to maximize growth opportunities and optimize business infrastructure and processes
Everett’s innovative products include more palatable and tolerable prenatal vitamins and other nutritional support products for patients in various health states. The transaction provided liquidity for the retiring founder, while affording his family members meaningful retained ownership, continued roles as the leaders of the company, and an ideal partner to support future growth
Supporting the next generation of management in their plans to invest in the expansion of Everett’s geographic footprint and direct sales force. Everett’s growth thesis also includes product line expansion, and select add-on acquisitions
