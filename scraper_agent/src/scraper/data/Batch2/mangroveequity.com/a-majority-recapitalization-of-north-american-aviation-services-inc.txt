A Majority Recapitalization of North American Aviation Services. Inc.
The team at Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce that we have completed a Majority Recapitalization of North American Aviation Services. Inc. (NAAS), a Texas-based provider of specialized aerospace fuel system maintenance and repair services.

Mangrove recently partnered with the owner/operators of San Antonio, Texas based North American Aviation Services. Inc. (NAAS) to affect a majority recapitalization of this leading provider of specialized aerospace fuel system maintenance and repair services. NAAS is one of only a few service providers authorized to perform this mission-critical work on a broad array of military and commercial aircraft.

Thank you for your continued interest and support. Please continue to think of us for majority recapitalizations, management buy-outs, management buy-ins, divisional acquisitions, and recap/ industry consolidations with private companies earning $2mm to $10mm of EBITDA throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Please visit Mangrove’s website at www.MangroveEquity.com for more detailed criteria and a sampling of the 52 industry/127 deal history of the Mangrove team.

Mangrove brought more than just the commodity of cash to the transaction and to NAAS:

Mangrove partners possess aerospace sector backgrounds and experience that helped us to understand this niche and relate to the owner/operators. Additionally, Mangrove’s experience with esoteric small business issues when selling to military customers was instrumental.

 

The Mangrove operating team will be working with management to implement more robust financial information systems and metrics to maximize quality growth for the company.

 

Mangrove has and will continue to support management’s initiatives to grow NAAS through the addition of new products/service lines as well as the addition of new locations, both domestic and international.
Mangrove has helped multiple portfolio companies build sales and marketing organizations.
