Phillip Marks Joins the Mangrove Equity Team

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the addition of Phillip Marks to our team.

Phillip is a graduate of the University of Florida. His passion for lower middle market companies and niche industries was spawned through his work with myriad private companies, focusing on their human capital management.

Phillip is an inveterate sports hound, which in his early career led him to work as a sportscaster and producer.

At Mangrove, Phillip works closely with Glenn Oken in identifying appropriate investment opportunities, and advancing them through Mangroveâ€™s new deal process.

As a reminder, Mangrove is an uncommonly experienced and active lower middle market private equity fund. Our four man internal operating team has a stellar track record of adding meaningful value to portfolio companies and helping Mangrove to be chosen by owner/operators, given their backgrounds and the value that they bring.

Mangrove invests in companies earning $2mm to $8mm of EBITDA, throughout the U.S. and Canada. Having been in 60+ industries we can quickly provide feedback regarding opportunities and demonstrate a strong level of understanding regarding a breadth of sectors.

While very opportunistic, the Mangrove team has enjoyed great success with manufacturing, mission-critical industrial services, enthusiast oriented consumer products, and value-added distribution sectors.

For over 20 years, Mangrove principals have made a practice of acting like partners to deal sources kind enough to think of us.

We hope to have the pleasure of working closely with you towards a closing.

Please reach out to Glenn Oken (goken@mangroveequity.com) or Phillip Marks (pmarks@mangroveequity.com) for any deal that could be a possible fit for Mangrove.
