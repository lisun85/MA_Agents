Mangrove Announces Investment in NORMco Pump & Power

Mangrove Equity Partners (“Mangrove”) is pleased to announce its investment in NORMco Pump & Power, LLC (“NORMco”), a Shawnee, OK-based manufacturer and specialty renter of portable, industrial pumps used for water transfer applications.

Founded in 2013 by Nathan and Vera Hanks, NORMco serves a core customer base made up of the leading water transfer solutions providers within the Permian Basin. Highly regarded in the industry and exceptionally responsive to customers’ mission-critical pumping needs, NORMco differentiates itself by providing reliable equipment and best-in-class maintenance and field service capabilities. The business achieved significant growth over the last several years and was looking for a partner to support the next phase of growth as NORMco begins to broaden its horizons and serve additional industries.

Along with Nathan and Vera, Mangrove partnered with Hunter Equity Capital (“HEC”), an independent sponsor focused on the equipment rental industry, on the transaction. HEC’s Managing Partner, Douglas Smith, commented, “I am excited to partner with Mangrove for a third time over the last decade in the specialty rental space. Together I am confident we are the right team to help Nathan and Vera scale the business and capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities at NORMco. Named after Nathan’s late father, family was at the foundation of NORMco’s culture from its initial launch and it’s critical to maintain that culture while they enter this exciting next phase. Mangrove’s internal operating team is a differentiator in this regard and the entire firm shows an uncommon commitment to helping entrepreneur and family-run businesses build meaningful value.”

Mr. Hanks will continue to serve as CEO and remains a significant equity owner in the business. “We are thrilled to join forces with Mangrove and HEC. This partnership represents a tremendous opportunity for us to accelerate our growth,” said Nathan. “It was clear that they shared our values, and we are confident this collaboration will lead to even greater success in the future for us and our team.”

Mangrove and NORMco are currently seeking to invest in additional specialty pump businesses with revenues from $5 million to $50 million. Inquiries can be directed to Matt Kane, Director of Sourcing at Mangrove Equity Partners (mkane@mangroveequity.com).
