Mangrove Supports Computer Aided Technologies in the Acquisition of 3DVision Technologies

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce Computer Aided Technology, LLC’s (“CATI”) recent acquisition of 3DVision Technologies, LLC, expanding the Company’s footprint into Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky.

This strengthens the Company’s position as one of the nation’s largest value added resellers of SolidWorks 3D computer aided design software and Stratasys 3D printers. Highlights of the acquisition include:

Solidified CATI’s position as a top-5 worldwide Solidworks and Stsratasys VAR
The acquisition of 3DVision marks the second add-on acquisition for CATI during its partnership with Mangrove. We were actively involved in the planning, negotiation, and diligence of both transactions and continue to support our management partners in their execution of their growth strategy
Our partnership with 3DVision allowed for the successful transition and retirement of 3DVision’s founder/CEO and facilitated his desire to retain ownership in the consolidated enterprise
Thus far, during our partnership with CATI, the company has more than doubled revenue and EBITDA
