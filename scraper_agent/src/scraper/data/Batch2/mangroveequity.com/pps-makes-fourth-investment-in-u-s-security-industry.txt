PPS Makes Fourth Investment in U.S. Security Industry

Patrol Protect Secure, Inc. is pleased to announce its fourth investment in the U.S. contract security industry with the acquisition of a leading provider of security services on the West Coast, focusing on vehicle patrol in select neighborhoods to both residences and commercial properties.

The value of this addition to PPS includes:

Partnering with a long-tenured, energetic management team that will be a force multiplier for the PPS team.
Expanding our geographic footprint to include the West Coast market.
The company’s vehicle patrol services are staffed by off-duty law enforcement officers, a segment of the security market where we have had much success, driven by market demand and the desire to staff armed functions with highly-trained law enforcement officers.
Our partnership provided ongoing leadership roles and opportunities for the company’s management team, while allowing one of the leaders to take a step back and transition into a part-time role, consistent with his goals.

Despite challenges presented by COVID-19, Mangrove and Sunlake Capital worked closely with this add-on to close the transaction with a very simple structure.

PPS is actively seeking acquisitions of like-minded contract security providers to support its growth in new and existing geographies.
