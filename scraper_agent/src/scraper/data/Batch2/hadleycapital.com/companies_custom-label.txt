The Situation

Hadley partnered with Custom Label’s existing managers and other industry executives to purchase Custom Label from its founder, who wanted to retire. Since the acquisition, Custom Label has invested significant capital to increase and modernize its production equipment, add sales and marketing personnel and complete add-on acquisitions.

The Outcome

Custom Label’s revenue has more than quadrupled since Hadley’s acquisition and it is now one of the leading label printers in Northern California.
