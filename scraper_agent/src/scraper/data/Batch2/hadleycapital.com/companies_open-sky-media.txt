Learn About The Company

OSM publishes city and lifestyle magazines that appeal to affluent readers living in healthy, fast-growing markets. The company was first formed via Hadley’s acquisition of Austin Monthly and San Antonio Magazine. OSM later acquired 405 Magazine, Marin Magazine and Gulfshore Life Magazine. Open Sky’s market-leading media brands produce the dominant lifestyle titles in their respective markets as well as a variety of digital, event and custom publishing products.

The Situation

OSM was created when Hadley acquired two Texas-based magazines from a media business that wanted to spin out the magazines. Open Sky Media subsequently acquired three additional magazines in California, Oklahoma and Florida.

The Outcome

Following many years of successful growth, Open Sky Media sold its titles in California, Oklahoma and Florida to various privately held media companies. Open Sky Media continues to operate an integrated media business based in Austin, Texas.
