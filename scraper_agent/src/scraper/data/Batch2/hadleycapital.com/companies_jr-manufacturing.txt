Learn About The Company

J&R manufactures commercial wood-fired smokers, broilers and rotisseries that use natural wood fire to deliver authentic Texas barbeque. Chefs and restaurateurs who pride themselves on the quality and authenticity of their Texas barbeque are devoted to J&R’s products, which are often proudly displayed in their restaurants. J&R has an extremely strong brand name and reputation for quality, and its customers include many of the most famous Texas barbeque chefs in the world. J&R was founded over 40 years ago and is based in Mesquite, Texas.

The Situation

Hadley acquired J&R from its founders who were ready to retire but who also wanted to see the business continue to grow and develop as an independent entity.

The Outcome

J&R is still in the Transition stage of the Hadley Ownership System™. We are optimistic about the company’s ability to transition, develop and grow over the next several years.
