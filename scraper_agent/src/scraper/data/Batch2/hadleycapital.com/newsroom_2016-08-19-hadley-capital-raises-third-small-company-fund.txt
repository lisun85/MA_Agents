Hadley Capital Raises Third Small Company Fund

August 19, 2016 - 1 min read

Earlier this year Hadley Capital announced the closing of our third small company fund.

For nearly 20 years, we have focused exclusively on buying small, profitable companies. We have been very successful at helping families address generational transitions, founders complete recapitalizations and management teams buy out inactive owners or founders. Read some of our success stories.

Just like in our prior funds, we are big investors in our third fund and our interests are well aligned with our investors and the business owners and management teams that we work with to improve and grow small companies.

If you own or represent a small company that meets our criteria, please contact us to discuss how we can help your company achieve its goals.

Paul Wormley - Managing Partner

Paul joined Hadley in 2005. He grew up in a family business environment and has spent his entire career working with small and emerging companies.

He currently works with Interstate Fabrications, Filter Holdings, J&R, AGI, Gillinder, Equustock, Pneu-Con, and Storflex. Previously he was the chairman or served on the board of directors for i-deal Optics, Centare, QDx Pathology, GT Golf Supplies, and Open Sky Media – all former Hadley companies.
