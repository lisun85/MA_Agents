Learn About The Company

PSI designs and manufactures advanced small-run protective packaging solutions for leading industrial manufacturing companies located throughout the Southwest. PSI’s customers include some of the most well-known companies in the defense, electronics, semiconductor, aerospace, and high-value consumer products industries. PSI is based in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Situation

Hadley partnered with PSI’s senior management team to acquire the business from PSI’s absentee owners.

The Outcome

Hadley owned PSI for nearly eight years, eventually selling it in 2017 to Packaging Concepts and Design, a large, integrated packing company based in Troy, Michigan. PSI was a successful investment for Hadley but it didn’t go as well as we had hoped due in part to the Great Recession which occurred shortly after we acquired the business.
