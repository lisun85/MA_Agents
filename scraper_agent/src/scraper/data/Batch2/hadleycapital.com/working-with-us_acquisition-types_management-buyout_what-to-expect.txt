Management Buyout Considerations

A management-led buyout can be an ideal way to address the needs of business owners and their dedicated management teams.

For business owners

create substantial liquidity through a sale;

exit day-to-day management;

leave the business in the hands of your experienced and capable team.

For a management team

become a meaningful owner, participate in the upside;

drive your growth plan;

gain more control over your destiny.
