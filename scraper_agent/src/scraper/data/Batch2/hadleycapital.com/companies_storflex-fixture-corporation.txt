Learn About The Company

Storflex designs and manufactures metal gondola display shelving, custom metal and wood fixtures, walk-in coolers and ancillary products, primarily for grocery stores. The company counts some of the nation’s largest supermarkets and specialty retailers as customers. These customers rely on Storflex to deliver high-quality modular shelving with high load factors under short lead times. Over the past twenty-five years, Storflex has developed one of the strongest brands in the shelving industry. Storflex operates out of a 170,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Corning, New York.

The Situation

With multiple generations of a family running the business, Storflex is the definition of a family business. Hadley acquired the business in partnership with a 2nd generation family member and promoted her to President.
