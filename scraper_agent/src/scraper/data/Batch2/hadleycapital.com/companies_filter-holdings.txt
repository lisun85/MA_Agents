Learn About The Company

Filter Holdings designs and manufactures advanced custom filter bags and related products. Pharmaceutical companies, food products manufacturers and other demanding industrial companies use Filter’s filters to recover small particles in static sensitive, high temperature and/or chemically aggressive environments. Filter is known for its deep product know-how, large stock of high-performance fabrics, high quality fabrication and fast delivery. Filter is based in Union, NJ, near New York City.

The Situation

Hadley acquired the two predecessor entities to Filter Holdings from their founder who had successfully built the businesses over many years. Hadley has successfully transitioned the business to a new management team including key members of the previous team.

The Outcome

Filter is now in the Foundation stage of the Hadley Ownership System™ and we are very optimistic about its long-term potential.
