Originator of Small Company Private Equity Hits Hard Cap for Fund IV

Chicago, IL and Nashville, TN, November 30, 2023 – Hadley Capital, a leading small company private equity firm, today announced the first and final closing for its fourth small company buyout fund totaling $50 million in capital commitments. Fund IV surpassed its target, demonstrating the strong support by Hadley’s investors for the firm's strategy.

"We are grateful for the confidence our investors have placed in our approach over the past 20 years. Our results allowed us to raise Fund IV in record time despite significant dislocation in the alternative asset fundraising environment," said Paul Wormley, Managing Partner at Hadley. "Hadley originated small company investing with the belief that we could assist owners, families, and management teams with transitioning and improving small companies – cumulatively, these businesses represent a critical portion of US economic output and employ nearly half of US workers.”

Hadley Capital Fund IV will advance Hadley’s proven strategy and partnership-driven approach. Hadley supports small company owners seeking ownership and management transition and has a track record spanning nearly 20 years. In Fund IV, Hadley will continue to acquire leading small companies, apply the Hadley Ownership System™ to provide critical operational and strategic support to its companies, and address the often complex needs of all stakeholders in a small company.

"Hadley is the unique firm where limited partners, the general partner, target company sellers, and portfolio company stakeholders are closely aligned. Over the last two decades, Hadley has developed a system for creating value across this spectrum and the results are differentiated in today’s private equity marketplace. Our success in raising Fund IV against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment is a validation of what we’ve built," said Clay Brock, Managing Partner at Hadley.

In addition to raising Fund IV, in the last 12 months, Hadley has completed three realizations and two small company acquisitions. In aggregate, Hadley has acquired 30 small companies, delivering significant value to small company stakeholders, owners partnered with Hadley, and Hadley investors. “Owners of small companies that are seeking management and ownership transition deserve an experienced and capable partner in a critical time in the life cycle of their business. These small company owners appreciate not only our experience but also our personal investments in our Fund and our partnership approach”, added George Malone, General Partner at Hadley.

Fund IV is composed of a small group of sophisticated limited partners who value the ability to access the small company private equity market via a proven general partner that has committed nearly 25% of the capital to Fund IV.

HMB Legal Counsel served as fund counsel for Fund IV.
