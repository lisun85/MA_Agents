Learn About The Company

Based in Ogden, Utah, Kelatron is a world leader in the production of raw material bioactive mineral nutrients for the nutritional, food, dietary supplement and medical industries. Backed by outstanding technical expertise, Kelatron offers premium products to manufacturers in the nutritional supplement, sports nutrition and functional food segments.

The Situation

Hadley partnered with the company’s existing management and an industry executive to purchase the business from Kelatron’s two owner/operators who were ready to retire. Hadley helped to transition management oversight of the business to the new team while simultaneously providing the owners with liquidity for retirement.

The Outcome

Hadley owned Kelatron for twelve years during which its revenue and profitability grew well. We then sold it in 2011 to Innophos, a large company that produces specialty phosphate and nutritional products.
