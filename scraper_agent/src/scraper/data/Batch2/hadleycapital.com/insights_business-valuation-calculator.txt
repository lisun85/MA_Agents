FACTS
Important Business Valuation Considerations

Valuation is more art than science — Ultimately, the value of anything being sold is what someone is willing to pay for it;

Value is in the eye of the beholder — It’s easy to be emotional about the value of something that you love;

Business characteristics influence valuation — Larger businesses generally receive higher valuations than smaller businesses;

Comparisons must be comparable — Just because your friend sold her business for 10x EBITDA does not mean your business is worth 10x EBITDA;

Transaction structure matters — All cash at a lower valuation may be more “valuable” than very little cash at a high valuation;

Finding the right buyer is important — A buyer that values specific elements of the business will generally value a business more highly.
