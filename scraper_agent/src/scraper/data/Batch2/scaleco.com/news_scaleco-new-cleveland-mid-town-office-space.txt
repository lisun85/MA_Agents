ScaleCo Capital’s New Office in Midtown Cleveland

ScaleCo Capital (“ScaleCo” or “the Company”) is thrilled to announce its official move to a newly designed and modern headquarters at the beginning of 2024. Located in Cleveland’s Midtown neighborhood, the new office space will serve as a hub for ScaleCo’s Portfolio Companies and local entrepreneurs seeking to acquire businesses. ScaleCo is excited to expand the employee base and team, collaborate closely with its portfolio companies, and host meetings and events for the local entrepreneurial community.

ScaleCo collaborated with Northeast Ohio companies such as Ohio Desk, JTL Construction,  and Geis Companies to design, manage, and construct the new interior. The over 5,000 square foot space was crafted to provide an inviting professional landscape for the Cleveland business community to organize events and engage in strategic brainstorming sessions.

Jim Doyle of Hemingway Development, Fred Geis, and the Geis Companies team spearheaded the construction and planning for the Midtown project. Geis Companies shares ScaleCo’s passion for driving economic and development growth in Northeast Ohio. Additionally, HSB Architects & Engineers, headquartered in Cleveland’s Flats neighborhood, provided their design services for the new development. Their expertise blends modern design with an understanding of the local area, ensuring the project fits seamlessly into Midtown Cleveland’s developing landscape.

ScaleCo envisions its new location as a space to share resources with local business owners, operators, and their teams. The new office marks the first step in ScaleCo’s plans to create positive change in the Cleveland business community, amplifying the city’s reputation as a hub for innovation, inclusion, and growth.

The new office location aligns well with ScaleCo mission to assist entrepreneurs across the Great Lakes region of the Midwest in achieving greater success.

The team’s expertise, proven strategies, and dedicated capital empowers businesses to scale effectively and achieve their goals.
