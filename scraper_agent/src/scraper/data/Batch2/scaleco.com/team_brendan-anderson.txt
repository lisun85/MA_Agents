Meet ScaleCo’s Founder & Managing Partner - Brendan Anderson
Brendan Anderson

Founder & Managing Partner

In 2018, Brendan Anderson founded ScaleCo Capital with a vision of helping small businesses scale and reach their growth potential. Today, he serves as Managing Partner and a voting member on ScaleCo’s Investment Committee. At ScaleCo Capital, Brendan focuses his time on vision building, fund-level strategy, deal sourcing, portfolio company performance, investor relations, and fundraising.

Throughout his career, Brendan has been dedicated to helping lower middle market companies not only succeed but thrive. He’s accumulated a wide range of experiences over the years, having served in various leadership roles across a number of companies operating in the business services, specialty manufacturing, and commercial lending industries.

Prior to founding ScaleCo, Brendan co-founded Evolution Capital Partners (“ECP”), a Cleveland-based private equity firm making control investments in micro-cap companies across the U.S. In 2018, he founded ScaleCo to invest in similar sized companies but with a greater emphasis on operational enhancements and a narrower geographic focus, prioritizing opportunities in the Midwest and Great Lakes-regions.

Brendan began his entrepreneurial journey in 1995 when he founded The Mast Group, a firm that offered management services to manufacturing, distribution, financial services, and other sectors. Then in 1996, he established the Heartland Companies to acquire a distressed industrial park based in the greater Chicago-area. Later in 1998, he acquired Ohio-based Stam, Inc., a manufacturing company where he gained extensive operational experience as the CFO, VP Sales, and Director of Stam until 2005.

Brendan’s career first began in Chicago, where he worked as a senior lending officer at American National Bank and HSBC Bank. He later expanded his lending expertise as an investor, board member, and loan committee member for a de-novo bank, American Heartland Bank.

Brendan is originally from Alliance, OH. He earned a BA in Economics from DePauw University and an MBA in Finance from Loyola University’s Quinlan School of Business.
