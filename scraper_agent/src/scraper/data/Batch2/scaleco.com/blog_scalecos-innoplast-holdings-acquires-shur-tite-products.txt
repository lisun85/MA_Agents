ScaleCo’s Innoplast Holdings Acquires Shur-Tite Products

ScaleCo Capital (“ScaleCo”), a lower middle market private equity firm based in Cleveland, OH, is excited to announce its investment in Shur-Tite Products, LLC (“Shur-Tite” or the “Company”), a leading provider of highway safety products used across the United States and globally. Shur-Tite is the second add-on acquisition for ScaleCo’s Innoplast Holdings (“Innoplast”), a manufacturer and value-added distributor of pedestrian and traffic safety solutions.

Located in Garfield Heights, OH, Innoplast was founded in 2005 and acquired by ScaleCo in April 2021. Innoplast is a manufacturer and value-added distributor of pedestrian and traffic safety solutions. This acquisition will grow the Innoplast portfolio, composed of subsidiaries Thermoprene and American Sign Products, to 80 employees.

Founded in 2000, Shur-Tite, which specializes in designing, manufacturing, and distributing highway safety, pedestrian safety, and traffic safety products, has a rich history of partnering with all constituents involved in state and municipal roadway safety, consistently delivering best-in-class products and customer service. Based in Gainesville, TX, the Company offers a broad portfolio of high-performance safety solutions to customers across the United States and five countries worldwide.

“Innoplast and ScaleCo couldn’t be happier with the addition of the Shur-Tite product line and team,” CEO of Innoplast Gary Bowling states, “This partnership diversifies our product offerings from parking lot assets to the DOT space, increasingly growing our focus and expanding our reach in the conspicuity and traffic safety sectors.”

Darrell Heald, President of Shur-Tite Products, states, “We believe both Innoplast’s and ScaleCo’s culture, based on Midwest values, aligns perfectly with our Texas style of doing business with service and integrity. Under Innoplast’s stewardship, Shur-Tite Products is poised for accelerated growth, expanded opportunities, and continuing its legacy of excellence in the traffic safety sector.”

“This acquisition represents an important milestone for Innoplast as it expands its portfolio by incorporating Shur-Tite,” expressed ScaleCo’s Founder and Managing Partner, Brendan Anderson. “The newly combined business will deliver an enhanced and diverse range of products leveraging combined expertise and resources to accelerate innovation and expansion.”

“Roadway safety has never been more important. Drivers are increasingly distracted behind the wheel while having to navigate congested roads and pedestrian traffic,” said ScaleCo Managing Partner, Dave Jacob. “Shur-Tite has been an innovator in this market while consistently improving vehicle and pedestrian safety. We are thrilled to partner with Darrell and the entire Shur-Tite team.”

Shur-Tite will continue operating under the name Shur-Tite Products and growing their operations in Gainesville, TX.

The team working on this investment with Anderson, Jacob, and Innoplast included Senior Associate Holli Roberts, Associate Nick Kuhn, and Director of Finance Dan Pioch. Charles Harris, Partner of Business Development, sourced the deal for ScaleCo.
