ScaleCo Capital Announces Owen Brewer as Operating Partner focused on Go-to-Market Strategies

ScaleCo Capital (“ScaleCo”) is excited to announce the addition of Owen Brewer as an Operating Partner focused on Go-to-Market (GTM) strategies. Owen brings extensive expertise as a revenue leader, specializing in driving growth for software and services businesses. In his role at ScaleCo, Owen will lead efforts to enhance GTM strategies across the portfolio, establish strong foundations for growth post-acquisition, and partner closely with leadership teams throughout the investment lifecycle.

Owen joins ScaleCo from Winning by Design, where he served as a Managing Director. There, he collaborated with leading private equity and venture capital firms to execute commercial transformations across their portfolio companies. His advisory expertise and hands-on approach have positioned him as a trusted partner in driving measurable outcomes.

Owen is also a Fulbright Fellow, holding a B.A. in International Studies from the Claremont Colleges and an MBA from INSEAD.

“ScaleCo has an opportunity to drastically accelerate growth at our portfolio companies. These businesses have established themselves through hard work and hands-on leadership but haven’t had the resources prior to ScaleCo to grow to the next level. We will work with portfolio company leadership to transform the way they go to market with better technology, process, messaging, and customer focus. We are going to make waves with our companies and their customers!” expressed Owen Brewer.

“Owen’s experience in developing and implementing growth strategies will play a pivotal role in enhancing the success of our portfolio companies,” said Brendan Anderson, Founder & Managing Partner of ScaleCo. “We’re excited to welcome him to the team and look forward to his impact across ScaleCo.”

ScaleCo Managing Partner Dave Jacob added, “Owen’s deep expertise in go-to-market strategies is invaluable as we continue to build scalable and repeatable processes for our portfolio companies. We are excited to have him on board, working closely with the team to accelerate growth and success.”
