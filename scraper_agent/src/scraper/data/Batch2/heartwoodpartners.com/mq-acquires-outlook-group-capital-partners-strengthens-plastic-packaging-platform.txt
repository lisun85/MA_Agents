================================================================================
Capital Partners® is pleased to announce that M&Q Holdings, LLC (“M&Q”), a portfolio company of Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP (“CP II”), acquired the operating assets and liabilities of Outlook Group Corp (“Outlook”) on October 17, 2016. M&Q was recapitalized in December 2015 with equity sourced from CP II along with M&Q’s senior management team and was CP II’s sixth platform investment.

Michael Schmal, president and CEO of M&Q, said, “We are excited to partner with Outlook. The combination is highly strategic because it brings together M&Q’s film and bag packaging with Outlook’s complementary labels, paperboard boxes, flexible package printing, conducting assembly and packaging operations. The new, larger platform will bring customers a comprehensive suite of packaging solutions supported by world-class engineering. Together, we will leverage our combined strengths by offering turn-key, more comprehensive, packaging solutions to support our customers’ growth. Capital Partners and management remain focused on continued growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.”

As with its other investments, Capital Partners® structured the initial M&Q recapitalization and the Outlook transaction primarily with equity and only a moderate level of debt financing to provide a strong balance sheet from which to grow.

Founded in 1977, Outlook Group (www.outlookgroup.com) is a leading provider of custom packaging solutions primarily food & beverage, consumer products and medical end markets. They focus on printing labels, cutting and printing on paperboard boxes, printing onto flexible packaging, and conducting assembly and / or packaging operations for customers using third party packaging and, in many cases, the customer’s product to create a finished good shippable directly to retailers. Outlook has over 275 highly-dedicated employees who operate out of two facilities in Neenah, Wisconsin. M&Q plans to operate Outlook largely independently. There are no planned changes to Outlook’s management, staff, facilities, suppliers, or customers.

Founded in 1956 and headquartered in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania, M&Q (www.mqplastics.com) designs and manufactures proprietary high-temperature resistant thermoplastic nylon, polyester, and polyamide packaging solutions for a variety of end markets. With more than 110 employees, the Company offers customers superior technology for custom packaging products with an ability to process different types of plastics, as well as deliver specific and specially-made solutions to various plastic applications coupled with a strong commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.
