TITLE: High Bar Brands Expands Its Iconic Brand Portfolio with the Acquisition of Dieter's Accessories - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
On May 17, 2023, High Bar Brands, LLC (“High Bar”) acquired Dieter’s Accessories (“Dieter’s”), a Canadian-based manufacturer aftermarket and OEM heavy-duty truck parts and stainless-steel accessories.
 
“We are excited to welcome Dieter’s Accessories into our family of brands,” said Christopher (“CT”) Thorpe, High Bar Brands CEO. “Dieter’s reputation, built on 40 years of exceptional quality, aligns perfectly with our commitment to exceeding customer expectations and providing customer solutions. This international acquisition marks an exciting milestone for us and represents a platform for further growth in Canada and the US.”
 
Dieter’s joins Minimizer, Premier Manufacturing, and Viking Mud Flaps as part of High Bar Brands’ expanding portfolio, creating synergy among different brands. Dieter’s long-tenured relationships with key, heavy-duty OEMs will further drive High Bar’s growth in that segment of the market across all of High Bar’s brands.
 
“We are thrilled with this strategic acquisition to further expand High Bar’s portfolio,” said Mark Allsteadt, Managing Partner, Heartwood Partners. “High Bar will be able to add another strong brand to their portfolio, drive growth through cross-selling opportunities and add Dieter’s steel manufacturing capabilities.”
