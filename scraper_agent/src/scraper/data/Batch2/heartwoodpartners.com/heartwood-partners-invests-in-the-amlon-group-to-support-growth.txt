================================================================================
Heartwood Partners LLC is pleased to announce a growth investment in The Amlon Group (“Company”) on December 10, 2021 in partnership with the founders and management who will continue to lead the Company.

Headquartered in Plano, Texas, The Amlon Group is an environmental services company focused on recycling, processing, treatment, and management of metal and non-metal bearing industrial and hazardous waste streams. Its environmentally beneficial solutions protect finite resources by remediating waste and recycling valuable commodities. With increasing landfill-related liability and constraints as well as growing federal and state regulations, companies today must look for sustainable alternatives when managing their waste. The Amlon Group is comprised of two closely integrated operating segments that play to this macro trend: Amlon Resources Group, LLC (“ARG”) and Alpha Omega Recycling, Inc. (“AORI”). ARG primarily acts as a waste management services and logistics company in metal recycling and reclamation, whereas AORI is ARG’s in-house waste processor. Acquired by ARG in 2017 to vertically integrate processing capabilities, AORI is RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) Part B permitted facility recycling metal-bearing industrial manufacturing by-products through thermal desorption among a variety of other technical processing and recycling capabilities.  Please visit ARG’s website at www.amlonresources.com to learn more about its recycling and waste management solutions or AORI’s website at www.alphaomegarecycling.com to learn more about its in-house waste processing abilities.

We are benefiting from Heartwood’s Value Creation Specialist team and strong track record in growing niche, leading businesses as we seek to further build upon our leadership position and 30+ years of experience in processing and recycling of hazardous materials.”
