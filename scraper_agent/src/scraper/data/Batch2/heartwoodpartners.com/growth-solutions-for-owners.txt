TITLE: Growth Solutions for Owners - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
HEARTWOOD PARTNERS HAS DEVELOPED ITS INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT FOUNDERS, OWNERS, AND MANAGEMENT TEAMS OF SMALL TO MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN ACHIEVING THEIR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL, AND PERSONAL GOALS.

Unlike traditional private equity firms, Heartwood applies a higher-equity, lower-debt approach that is designed to give our portfolio companies the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions and fund capital expansion.

Our transactions are capitalized with roughly half the level of debt typically used in private equity transactions so our companies can thrive in more difficult economic climates or when business challenges arise.  Furthermore, we use the cash that is not flowing toward incremental interest payments associated with higher debt levels to invest in growth initiatives and to provide current income for equity holders, such as founders, owners, and managers investing alongside Heartwood.

OUR APPROACH IN ACTION

Heartwood prides itself on creating an ecosystem where founders, owners, and management teams can thrive. We offer in-house operations, marketing, digital, direct-to-consumer, and human resource expertise to further support our portfolio companies and identify avenues of potential growth for the near and long term.
