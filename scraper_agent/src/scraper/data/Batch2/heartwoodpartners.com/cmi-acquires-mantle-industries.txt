================================================================================
Capital Partners is pleased to announce that on October 31, 2018 its investment company, CMI Limited Co., purchased Mantle Industries, a leading producer of aluminum ramps, gangways, catwalks and bridges used in marine environments. Mantle serves the northwest United States, Alaska and Canada from their facility based in Blaine, Washington. Mantle, along with CMI’s existing aluminum fabrication division, Gator (GatorDock and GatorBridge), will continue to serve the aluminum marine access and pedestrian bridge markets with an expanded product offering and geographical reach.

“The Mantle purchase demonstrates CMI’s continued commitment to the aluminum fabricated structures market,” said Duane Bryant, President and CEO of CMI. “This acquisition expands our fabrication expertise, production capacity and market coverage.” Mantle’s founder and seller, John Wasilewski, stated, “I’m happy to have found a home for Mantle, a company I’ve run for 41 years. I am confident CMI will be a good steward for Mantle’s interests. I couldn’t be more happy with the process or outcome.”

CMI, headquartered in Marietta, Georgia, has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Florida and Washington. The company operates two divisions; CMI is the leading manufacturer of vinyl, fiber-reinforced polymer, aluminum sheet piling serving marine, retaining wall, flood protection and water control applications as well as some of the most challenging chemical containment, levee stabilization and groundwater cut-off applications; and Gator and Mantle are leading fabricators of aluminum bridge, dock, gangway and access solutions serving recreational marinas, residential and commercial dock and access markets. The company provides design, engineering, project management and proprietary installation equipment to enable complete application solutions.

Capital Partners and management remain focused on continued growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.
