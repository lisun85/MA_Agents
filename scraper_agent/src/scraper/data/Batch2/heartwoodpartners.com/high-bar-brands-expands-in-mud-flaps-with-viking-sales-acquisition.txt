TITLE: High Bar Brands Expands in Mud Flaps with Viking Sales Acquisition - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
On August 5, 2022, High Bar Brands, LLC (“High Bar” or “HBB”) acquired Viking Sales, Inc (“Viking Sales or Viking”), a Brighton, Michigan-based manufacturer of rubber and polyethylene mud flaps for original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and the aftermarket.

“For over 50 years, Viking has provided custom mud flaps to the transportation industry, and we see the addition of Viking’s capabilities clearly complimenting the brand portfolio within High Bar Brands,” said Christopher Thorpe “CT”, High Bar Brands CEO. “Along with rubber mud flap solutions, Viking also sources raw polyethylene to produce industry-leading mud flap products, offering custom logos with rain-guard, anti-spray, and anti-sail technologies.”

Under the High Bar Brands umbrella, the brand will have expanded marketing/sales support and an expansive distribution network throughout North America. The High Bar Brands portfolio will also benefit from Viking’s deep-rooted OEM relationships and high-quality manufacturing capabilities. Viking’s manufacturing process is ISO-9001 certified.

“We are pleased to support High Bar with this exciting acquisition,” said Mark Allsteadt, Managing Partner, Heartwood Partners. “The acquisition of Viking creates opportunities to take advantage of Viking’s strong polyethylene sourcing and vertical manufacturing capabilities, and to continue to grow the Viking brand under High Bar. Moving forward High Bar will remain an active acquirer in the heavy-duty space.”

Hart Marx acted as a buy-side advisor to High Bar Brands.
