Capital Partners® is pleased to announce that Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP completed an acquisition of CMI Limited Co. (“CMI”) (www.cmilc.com) on September 18, 2017 from Crane Group, a family-owned holding company headquartered in Columbus, OH. Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Marietta, GA, CMI is the nation’s largest manufacturer of marine vinyl sheet piling and benefits from ShoreGaurd®, the industry’s most recognized brand, and its reputation for quality. CMI’s product line includes vinyl, composite, and aluminum sheet piling for cut-off & containment, flood protection, and water control as well as aluminum docks and access bridges used primarily for access to marine locations. CMI customers include distributors, contractors, engineering firms, commercial institutions (hotels, oil refineries, etc), and government entities.

Capital Partners and CMI management are focused on growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions. As is typical for new investments by Capital Partners, we are backing a strong, well-established management team at CMI, led by Duane Bryant (CEO). Capital Partners financed the transaction primarily with equity in order to provide a strong balance sheet from which to implement CMI’s growth plan. Duane Bryant stated “Capital Partners provides CMI with the financial strength and board room expertise required to accelerate our growth through investing in sales and marketing, greater efficiency, and acquisitions.”
