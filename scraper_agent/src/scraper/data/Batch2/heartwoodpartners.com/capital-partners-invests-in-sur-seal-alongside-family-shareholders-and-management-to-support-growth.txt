Capital Partners® is pleased to announce that Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund III, LP completed an investment in Sur-Seal LLC (“Sur-Seal”) on June 1, 2018 in partnership with family shareholders and its management, who will continue to lead the company.

Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Sur-Seal is a leading provider of custom-designed sealing solutions along with related components and assemblies. Its products are used in critical applications by OEMs in the lighting, heating and cooling, medical, and various industrial end-markets. Sur-Seal prides itself on partnering with customers to provide engineering support, rapid prototype development, and outstanding quality and customer service.

“When looking for the right partner for Sur-Seal, our family chose to work with Capital Partners because they shared our belief that taking care of our people and supporting the next chapter of growth are top priorities. Throughout the diligence process Capital Partners proved to be a high-integrity firm that does exactly what it says it will do,” said Jim Wilz, board member and second-generation owner. Sur-Seal’s CEO, Larry Faist, added, “As Sur-Seal enters its next chapter of ownership, we know that we can trust Capital Partners to continue the legacy that the Wilz family has built and that our employees and customers will benefit from an experienced and reliable partner behind us.”

Capital Partners’ equity investment will provide Sur-Seal with additional resources to support the rapid growth of the Company including investing in people, equipment, and the development of additional capabilities.

“One of the many things that we value is Sur-Seal’s deep focus on cultivating customer relationships and finding new and creative ways to solve its customers’ toughest problems. We are excited to partner with the team at Sur-Seal to pursue the growth opportunities that lie ahead,” said James Sidwa, Managing Director at Capital Partners.
