TITLE: ChromaScape Expands its Packaging Chemical Line with CEL Chemical Acquisition - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
ChromaScape, LLC (“ChromaScape”) has acquired CEL Chemical, Inc. (“CEL Chemical”).  Based in Piedmont, South Carolina, CEL Chemical is a manufacturer of adhesives, additives, modifiers and enhancers used in the corrugated paperboard packaging industry. CEL Chemical’s products allow manufacturers to create more-durable, waterproof corrugated paperboard at higher throughput rates  and with reduced waste.

“We are excited to add CEL Chemical’s products to our product line.,” said Seth Tomasch, Chief Executive Officer of ChromaScape. “Customers love these products because they help paperboard plants run more efficiently and deliver improved product. ChromaScape’s focus on quality, on-time delivery and customer service will support the continued growth of this highly differentiated product line.”

“We were pleased to support ChromaScape with this strategic acquisition to expand ChromaScape’s packaging-related product portfolio,” said Sarah Paquet, Principal, Heartwood Partners. “ChromaScape’s strong management team is uniquely positioned to support CEL Chemical’s growth as its founder, Jim Messenger, retires after 35 years spent driving CEL Chemical to the success it has achieved.”

Heartwood Partners is focused on partnering with family and management-owners. Our strategy is focused on providing strategic and financial guidance, human resources development, marketing and eCommerce expertise, and operational assistance to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.
