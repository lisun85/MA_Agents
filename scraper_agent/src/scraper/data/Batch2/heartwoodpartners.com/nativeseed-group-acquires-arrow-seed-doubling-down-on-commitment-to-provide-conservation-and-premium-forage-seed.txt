TITLE: NativeSeed Group Acquires Arrow Seed, Doubling Down on Commitment to Provide Conservation and Premium Forage Seed - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
Heartwood Partners is pleased to announce that after four generations of family ownership, Arrow Seed has joined Heartwood’s growing seed and erosion control platform, NativeSeed Group (“NativeSeed”). Located in Broken Bow, Nebraska, Arrow Seed is a producer and supplier of conservation and premium native grass, wildflower, forages, turf grasses, small grains and other related varieties of seeds and seed mixes for farm and conservation applications, primarily serving the Midwest. Customers include seed distributors, retailers, farmers, state and local conservation districts, municipalities, and private landowners. In addition to expanding NativeSeed’s geographic footprint into the Midwest, the acquisition bolsters its product portfolio with expanded warm-season seed varieties. This is the second add-on acquisition completed by NativeSeed Group since Heartwood Partners acquired the business in April 2022.

“We were fortunate to have been presented with this opportunity as we continue to expand our geographic footprint,” said NativeSeed Group CEO Rob Wendell. “Arrow Seed’s core values, rooted in providing customers with high quality custom seed mixes on a just-in-time basis, align perfectly with how we do business. We also see a tremendous fit with our Star Seed operation (www.gostarseed.com) in nearby Osborne, Kansas, by sharing resources and best practices in procurement and customer service. Both entities will be better positioned to deliver immediate value to the market and be ideally positioned to meet projected long-term growth in cover crops and conservation throughout the Midwest.”

“We are pleased to support NativeSeed with its second strategic acquisition, helping the platform further add scale and grow its footprint,” said James Sidwa, Managing Partner, Heartwood Partners. “We look forward to continuing to build NativeSeed Group’s portfolio of brands and continuing to invest in future growth.”

Heartwood Partners and NativeSeed would like to recognize the advisory team at Verdant Partners for their efforts in closing this transaction and making this partnership possible.
