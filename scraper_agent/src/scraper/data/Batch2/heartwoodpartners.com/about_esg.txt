HEARTWOOD PARTNERS RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) FACTORS WITHIN OUR OWN FIRM AND THE COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE PARTNER.

Heartwood Partners pursued a more formal ESG initiative beginning in 2019. This was an important step forward for the firm as it enables deeper consideration of how the capital it deploys influences not just the growth and profitability of the companies in which it invests, but also other key factors such as the employees, surrounding communities and environment.

Heartwood Partners’ initial approach to ESG is summarized in the following ESG Investment Policy Statement.
