================================================================================
Sur-Seal, a leader in custom-engineered converting and manufacturing solutions, has acquired Kent Manufacturing LLC, a Michigan-based third generation family company with a national reputation for excellence in the custom converting industry. This strategic partnership creates a powerful platform serving the rapidly growing healthcare market, with enhanced capabilities to deliver comprehensive converting and sealing solutions to this demanding sector.

“The acquisition is a significant building block for Sur-Seal’s exciting future,” explains Pete Futia, Chief Executive Officer of Sur-Seal. “Kent’s enhanced medical cleanroom capabilities and ISO-13485 quality management system will allow Sur-Seal to better serve healthcare customers. We look forward to combining our capabilities for a comprehensive offering.”

“We are thrilled to support Sur-Seal’s further expansion into the healthcare market with the acquisition of Kent, which will further support Sur-Seal’s medical customers with an additional cleanroom for production,” said James Sidwa, of Heartwood Partners, Sur-Seal’s primary investor.

The acquisition of Kent positions Sur-Seal as one of the only converters in North America with industry-leading technical certifications in the healthcare, aerospace, and automotive sectors. Further, the addition of manufacturing operations in Michigan allows Sur-Seal to bring its expertise and status as one of the largest 3M Preferred converters in North America to better serve customers throughout the region with its rapid delivery model.

“Sur-Seal shares Kent’s values in treating customers, suppliers and employees right. They bring resources, expertise, and opportunities that will allow Kent Manufacturing to grow, innovate and thrive in ways we couldn’t achieve on our own,” says Mike Muraski, former owner of Kent. “We also believe our customers will appreciate the expansion of capabilities including wide-web laminating, foam skiving, waterjet cutting, wide and narrow-web flatbed converting, and supply chain services including storage, kitting and parts assembly.”
