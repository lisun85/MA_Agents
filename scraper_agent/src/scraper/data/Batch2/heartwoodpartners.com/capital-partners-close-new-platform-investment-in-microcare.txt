Capital Partners®, based in Norwalk, CT, is pleased to announce that Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund III, LP, a $600 million committed fund, completed a control investment in MicroCare, LLC (“MicroCare”) on May 28, 2020, in partnership with the company’s co-founder and senior management.

“We closed this investment in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis as our low-debt approach to private equity allowed us to move forward and the company has proven to be a strong, recession-resistant essential business, which should benefit from a growing global focus on cleanliness and the increasing importance of telecom infrastructure,” said Sarah Paquet, Vice President at Capital Partners.

Headquartered in New Britain, CT, and serving a global market, MicroCare is an innovative developer, manufacturer, filler, and packager of industrial-use cleaning fluids, coatings, related packaging, and dispensing solutions for the electronics, fiber optic, medical, and precision cleaning end markets. Please visit the MicroCare web site at www.microcare.com to learn more about innovative MicroCare products and market applications.

Tom Tattersall, CEO of MicroCare, stated “I am excited to partner with Capital Partners because of the strategic value they add to make MicroCare more competitive servicing our existing customers, while we invest in developing new manufacturing capabilities for new products that address emerging cleaning needs in global industries such as fiber optics and medical device manufacturing. Capital Partners’ focus on establishing a strong balance sheet through lower debt was a significant differentiator for our team.”

“MicroCare is a leader in multiple, highly-attractive industrial end markets.” said Ed Tan, Managing Director of Capital Partners, who also added, “MicroCare is a perfect fit with our approach of partnering with great managers and investing in a business with strong organic growth potential and attractive strategic acquisition opportunities.”

Capital Partners is focused on partnering with family and management-owners. Our approach includes robust capital structures and providing strategic, human resources development, and marketing and e-commerce expertise, to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.
