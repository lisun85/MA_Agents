================================================================================
Capital Partners Holdings, Inc. (“Capital Partners”) is pleased to announce that on October 30, 2017, Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP (“Fund II”), Breen management and co-investors sold Breen Color Concentrates, LLC (“Breen” or the “Company”) (www.breencolor.com) to Arsenal Capital Partners (“Arsenal”), a New York-based private investment firm. Breen is a producer of color and additive concentrates for the plastics industry, and is headquartered in Lambertville, NJ. Howard DeMonte, President of the Company, and the senior management team will continue to lead Breen.

Howard DeMonte commented, “We developed a strong partnership and bond with the Capital Partners team. They exhibited high integrity and strategic acumen over the last several years and played an instrumental role in helping us double our revenue. Their unique investment structure involving only moderate debt leverage enabled Breen to create equity value by pursuing important longer-term growth investments and completing a transformative add-on acquisition while also generating a current yield for shareholders and management.”

During the investment period, Capital Partners worked with the senior management team to develop and implement a strategic plan. In February 2016, Breen completed the acquisition of Hudson Color, which addressed the core elements of Breen’s strategic plan. The senior managers have been wonderful partners and Capital Partners wishes them continued success in their partnership with Arsenal.

BlackArch Partners served as exclusive financial advisor to Breen and Capital Partners.
