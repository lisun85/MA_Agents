TITLE: Minimizer announces plan to build new one-hundred-thousand square foot facility in Owatonna - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
As part of its long-term strategic growth plan, developed alongside Capital Partners’ following their equity investment in the business in 2018, Minimizer is in the final planning stage for a new facility located in Owatonna, Minn.

“We are excited that Capital Partners’ approach to equity investing provides us with a strong balanced position required to further our growth and make this investment in capacity and efficiency possible. Given our current and future sales growth, as well as new product introductions, the new facility is a necessity,” Minimizer CEO Christopher Thorpe “CT” said. “We are currently operating out of three buildings and we are simply out of room in Blooming Prairie and need more efficient space.”

Minimizer currently employs 83 people across three separate campuses in Blooming Prairie. The proposed site in Owatonna will house all employees in one facility while substantially increasing the company’s operating space from fifty-four thousand square feet to ninety-six thousand square feet.
The company hopes to break ground on the new facility next month and plans to be moved in by the spring of 2021.

“Our employees are the backbone of Minimizer,” CT said. “We had opportunities to construct a new facility in other cities, but Owatonna is only 20 miles from Blooming Prairie and we didn’t want to lose our current workforce when they are vitally important to our future success.”
