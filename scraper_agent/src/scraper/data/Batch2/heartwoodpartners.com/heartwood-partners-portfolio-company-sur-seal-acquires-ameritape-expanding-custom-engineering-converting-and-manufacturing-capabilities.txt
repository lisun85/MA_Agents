Sur-Seal acquires Ameritape, Expanding Custom Engineering, Converting, and Manufacturing Capabilities

Sur-Seal, a leader in the custom sealing solutions industry, has acquired Ameritape, a Florida-based company specializing in custom die cutting, slitting, and laminating for the aerospace industry. The acquisition will help Sur-Seal and Ameritape better serve their expanded customer base and continue their recent growth.

“We are thrilled about the acquisition of Ameritape,” explains Dana Waterman, Chief Executive Officer of Sur-Seal. “Their similar end market exposure and competitive positioning to Sur-Seal means that the Ameritape team will be able to partner fluidly with Sur-Seal to provide customers with sophisticated engineering solutions. We value Ameritape’s aerospace expertise and look forward to combining our capabilities for a comprehensive offering.”

“Ameritape’s capabilities and focus on aerospace applications are a great complement to Sur-Seal’s existing business.  The combined engineering capabilities, materials expertise and manufacturing excellence will allow both companies to provide their existing and new customers with a more comprehensive solutions offering” explained James Sidwa of Heartwood Partners, Sur-Seal’s primary investor. 

The acquisition of Ameritape expands Sur-Seal’s engineering capabilities, including performance materials expertise and manufacturing techniques. The organization looks forward to continuing to provide customized gaskets and other sealing and filtering components using the most effective manufacturing techniques available. Additionally, Sur-Seal is pleased to expand our customers relationships in the Southern US. 

“We are delighted to be acquired by Sur-Seal as they are a company that shares our values of superior customer service and a positive work culture to provide custom engineering solutions,” says Tom Whipple, former owner of Ameritape and current Director of Sur-Seal Jacksonville. “In addition to offering a variety of die-cut options, we can now offer custom rubber, silicone molded and extruded parts. We also believe our customers will also appreciate the expansion of our supply chain services that includes storage, kitting and parts assembly.”
