TITLE: Capital Partners 2018 Year In Review: Another Successful Year - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
Our low-leverage approach and focus on family and management held businesses helped make 2018 a productive year for Capital Partners:

Four new platform investments
Two add-on investments
Successful exit of Roll Rite investment
Additions to the Capital Partners team
FOUR NEW PLATFORM INVESTMENTS COMPLETED

In 2018 we invested in four new platform companies. In each investment we were fortunate to purchase family and management held businesses in partnership with incumbent management teams who continue to lead the business. We seek to identify and close corporate add-on acquisitions for each.

1. FLETCHER-TERRY
Capital Partners completed an acquisition of The Fletcher-Terry Company, (www.fletcher-terry.com) on January 23, 2018.
