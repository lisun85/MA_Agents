================================================================================
Sur-Seal, a leader in the custom sealing solutions industry, has acquired Mueller, a North Carolina-based company specializing in custom die cutting, slitting, laminating, and CNC cutting.  Mueller brings its manufacturing excellence to creating custom solutions for the most challenging of customer needs. It operates out of a 141,000 square foot facility and is the only aerospace-qualified die cut company in the Southeast. The acquisition will help Sur-Seal and Mueller meet the needs of their expanded customer base.

“Mueller’s capabilities and industry focus in aerospace, medical, renewable energy, and electronics are a great complement to Sur-Seal’s existing business.  The combined engineering capabilities, materials expertise and manufacturing excellence will allow both companies to provide their existing and new customers with a more comprehensive solutions offering” explained James Sidwa, a member of the Sur-Seal Board of Directors.

“Mueller has grown into an industry leader in its markets under the ownership of the Stober Family. Ken and Carl Stober have built an outstanding company and fostered an employee-centric culture. We are proud to partner with Mueller and combine its talented team and capabilities with Sur-Seal” added Andrea Vandersall, a member of the Sur-Seal Board of Directors.

The acquisition of Mueller creates an expansion of engineering capabilities to offer a broad portfolio of performance materials and enhanced manufacturing techniques. The combined organization looks forward to continuing to provide customized gaskets and other sealing and filtering components using the most effective manufacturing techniques available. Sur Seal is pleased to expand manufacturing capabilities in the southeastern U.S. through Mueller’s world-class facility in North Carolina. The addition will serve to augment manufacturing options across the region.

“We are delighted to be acquired by Sur-Seal as they are a company that shares our values of superior customer service and a positive work culture that specializes in providing comprehensive engineering solutions,” says Pete Futia, Vice President of Mueller. “In addition to offering a variety of die-cut options, we can now offer our customers custom rubber and silicone molded and extruded parts. We believe our customers will also appreciate the expansion of our supply chain services that will include storage, kitting, and parts assembly.”

The acquisition of Mueller follows Sur-Seal’s acquisition of Spectex, a specialty materials converter based in Dover, NH, which closed in May of 2021.
