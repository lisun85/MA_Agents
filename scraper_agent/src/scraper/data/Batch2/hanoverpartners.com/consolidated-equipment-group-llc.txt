Company Description

Consolidated Equipment Group, LLC is the leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of attachments for skid-steers loaders, mini skid-steers, compact tractors, utility terrain vehicles, all terrain vehicles, and other light-construction equipment. The Company has developed over 90 different attachments sold direct to end-users and through a vast dealer network. The Company’s attachments are uniquely designed to universally fit across all major machinery platforms such as Bobcat, CNH, Caterpillar, and John Deere and are used for numerous applications such as landscaping, agriculture, snow removal, excavation, and light-construction. Since the Company’s founding in 2002, it has consistently introduced new products, entered new markets, acquired related companies, and delivered exceptional customer service and support.  With over 150 employees Quick Attach has rapidly become one of the largest manufacturers of light-construction machinery attachments in the United States.  Based in Minnesota, Consolidated Equipment Group’s products are sold worldwide.

In 2012, Hanover Partners acquired a majority of the Company from its founder who continues to hold a significant equity stake in the Company and remains as President and CEO. In 2013, consistent with the original recapitalization objective, a substantial growth capital investment was made to finance the construction of an additional state-of-the-art production facility, as well as expanded operations for a growing in-house sales force.
