John Kett

Operating Advisor

PROFESSIONAL

John is an accomplished automotive industry executive with over 20 years of experience in the auto aftermarket space. Most recently, John served as CEO and President of IAA, a leading online auction platform for salvaged vehicles worldwide. While at IAA, he drove unprecedented growth over a 10-year period while pioneering innovative product development strategies including a full digital transformation of the business. His focus on digitization and data resulted in broadening the service offering and growing top and bottom-line results.

John also has experience building out a strong board of directors across a variety of subjects. At IAA, he was directly involved in all of the committees, development of the strategic plan, and in getting shareholder approval of the combination with RB Global (NYSE:RBA). This culminated in the successful completion of the merger in March 2023, valuing IAA at over $7 billion. Mr. Kett previously led the company through a successful spin off in 2019 from KAR Global (now Openlane [NYSE:KAR]) and built out the necessary infrastructure, processes and functions to operate independently.

Prior to the public phase of IAA/KAR, John worked very closely with several private equity sponsors as the CFO and president of IAA, helping it grow both organically and inorganically through a series of M&A transactions. John’s earlier career included experience in metal distribution, auto glass, and electronics distribution and began in public accounting.

John currently serves on the Board of B&R Auto, a Highview portfolio company.

EDUCATION

John earned a Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School at Northwestern University. He also holds a Bachelor’s of Science in Accounting from Northern Illinois University.
