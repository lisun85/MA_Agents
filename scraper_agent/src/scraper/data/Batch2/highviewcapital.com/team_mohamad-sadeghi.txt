Mohamad Sadeghi

Associate

PROFESSIONAL

Mohamad Sadeghi is an Associate at Highview Capital. Mohamad is responsible for all aspects of the investment process including sourcing, diligence, and execution of new investments. Prior to Highview, Mohamad worked at Ares Management, a global private equity firm based in Los Angeles, where he focused on buyouts across the industrials, consumer, business services, and healthcare sectors. Mohamad began his career in investment banking at Perella Weinberg Partners in the M&A advisory group.

EDUCATION

Mohamad holds a B.S. in Business Administration with High Honors from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.

PERSONAL

Mohamad grew up in Los Angeles, CA and now resides in Santa Monica. In his free time, Mohamad enjoys staying active, exploring LA’s vibrant food scene, and picking up new sports. Despite not winning a single match during his freshman year, Mohamad wrestled his way to becoming the captain of his high school’s varsity wrestling team – proving that persistence (and maybe a few lucky pins) pays off.
