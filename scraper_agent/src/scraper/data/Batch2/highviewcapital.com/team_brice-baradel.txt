PERSONAL

Brice grew up in Maryland (raised in Annapolis and went to high school in Baltimore). He lived in New York City for 15 years and then started his westward migration by spending 3 years in Minneapolis before finally landing in Manhattan Beach where he lives with his wife and two boys.

Brice loves watching UVA sports (the ups and downs are forever mitigated by the 2019 national championship in basketball), is a long-suffering Washington Commanders fan (Jayden Daniels though!), and is an ardent supporter of the US men’s national soccer team.

In his free time, he enjoys hanging with the family, watching sports, playing poker, skiing, and aspires to attain “below average” golf proficiency (up from “terrible”).
