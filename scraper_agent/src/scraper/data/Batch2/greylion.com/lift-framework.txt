THE GREYLION LIFT APPROACH

Our disciplined, repeatable approach has successfully served as our playbook for investing–from sourcing to exit–through multiple macroeconomic cycles.

LEADERSHIP
A relentless focus on talent and the individuals leading an organization – GreyLion seeks to ensure that each portfolio company has the human resources to grow.

TECHNOLOGY
A core component of the success of any business is access to sophisticated technology – GreyLion seeks to ensure portfolio companies can harness top quality systems and processes to drive efficiency and production.

INVESTMENT
“Changing the slope of the curve” is of paramount importance to the team – this means re-investing in businesses and their infrastructure to catalyze geographic and product expansion.

FLEXIBILITY
Conservative balance sheet management provides flexibility to drive growth through operational improvement; openness to minority investments broadens the pool of targets.

Consistency over several decades has led to an all-weather growth strategy resistant to industry “fads”.
GreyLion seeks out certain attributes in order to effectively leverage the LIFT approach:
Strong management teams
Often first institutional capital
Sustainable competitive advantages
Defensible IP and/or differentiated products
Strong alignment with equity rollover
High degrees of customer loyalty
