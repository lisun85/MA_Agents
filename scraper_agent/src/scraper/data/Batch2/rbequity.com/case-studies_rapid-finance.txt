Rapid Finance
Rebuilding the Technology Platform

Rapid and Rockbridge worked together to architect a scalable technology platform that enabled process efficiencies and increased margins:

The former Chief Technology Officer at Rocket Mortgage worked with Rapid’s Chief Technology Officer to develop new underwriting, loan origination, and servicing modules
Rockbridge worked with management to implement technology-enabled process redesigns to allow Rapid to scale volume in a cost-efficient manner
Making Strategic Introductions Through the Rock Family of Companies

When the COVID-19 pandemic affected small businesses, Rapid and Rockbridge were able to leverage Rocket Loans’ relationship with the United States Small Business Association (SBA) to stand up the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, which administered more than $400 billion of loans and grants to small businesses affected by COVID.

Rapid Finance stood up the EIDL loan program in four weeks and was able to do so, in part, because of the investment Rockbridge had enabled early in its investment period.
The program administered relief to more than 7 million of the 32 million small businesses in the United States in 18 months
