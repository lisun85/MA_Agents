Testimonials and endorsements reflect Rockbridge Growth Equity’s and portfolio company management's opinions and beliefs regarding the company and the investment. Such opinions and beliefs are subjective, do not represent a complete assessment of the company, the market, or Rockbridge Growth Equity's overall investment performance and cannot be independently verified. Such statements are being offered as references for purposes of demonstrating the benefits of working with the Rockbridge Growth Equity team and not for the purpose of soliciting investors. Portfolio company executives receive/received a salary and economics from the portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all speakers stand to benefit from Rockbridge Growth Equity's success, and they work/worked for a Rockbridge Growth Equity portfolio company.

The “Founder-Friendly Investors” award is a program designed by Inc. Magazine to help founder-led companies accelerate growth and create revenue. Private equity and venture capital firms that have exited U.S.-based, founder-led portfolio companies are eligible to apply. For investments to qualify, portfolio company founders must have remained actively involved in their business for at least one-year post-investment. Winning firms are selected based upon their track record, reputation, leadership and founder references. Rockbridge is not aware of the number of advisers also surveyed for the award. Like all entrants, Rockbridge paid a fee to be considered for this award and pays a fee to Inc. Magazine to use the collateral associated with the use of the award and logo. This award is not to be construed as indicative of Rockbridge’s future performance. Reference to an award is only one piece of information relevant to an evaluation of an investment adviser such as Rockbridge. Finally, this award represents information as of a specific date and time and may not reflect important information related to an evaluation of the investment adviser which has occurred prior to, or subsequent to, the award.
