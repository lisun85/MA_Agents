Kel
Landis, Co-Founder and Partner of Plexus Capital, passed away on January 2, 2021. We are privileged to have known, worked with and learned from Kel these past few decades, through which he has impacted so many individuals, families and businesses. Kel’s leadership style and work ethic support the helix of the Plexus DNA. In 2014, Kel published “The Little Book of Do”, where he illustrates the ethos that by doing, we become. In 2019, Plexus created a book for Kel called, “The Little Book of BEing Kel Landis III” to honor his work and inspiration.

Kel was a respected business and community leader, devoted to helping others and inspiring his fellow citizens to do the same. In 2020, Governor Roy Cooper awarded Kel with the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, which is our state’s highest civilian honor. Kel served on the UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Trustees, chaired and served on the Board of the Kenan Flagler Business School and the UNC Board of Visitors, and was a member of the UNC Foundation’s Board of Directors.

In 2019, the UNC Board of Trustees granted Kel the William Richardson Davie award, which is given to those who exemplify dedication, commitment and service to the University. He was also former chair of the North Carolina Bankers Association, served as Senior Advisor for Business and Economic Affairs for the Governor of North Carolina and served as Trustee of the North Carolina State Supplemental Retirement Fund. Kel was also a Board member for the North Carolina Community Foundation, which helps support community foundations across the state.

Looking Ahead

Our strategy is to sticking to what we know. That means investing in the same types of businesses and partnerships we always have. We will do so while preserving our culture rooted in Kel’s legacy and the team’s collective ambition.

We will invest in technology, processes and talent ahead of growth, but will only be as successful as our team and partnerships are.
