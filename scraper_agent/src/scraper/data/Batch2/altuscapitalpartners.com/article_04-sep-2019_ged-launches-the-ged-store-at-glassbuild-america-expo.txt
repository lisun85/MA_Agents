GED Launches The GED Store at GlassBuild America Expo

Glenwillow, Ohio – September 4, 2019 | The GED Store will open to the public at GlassBuild America 2019, booth 1935. This new online platform is all about simplifying the ordering process for GED Integrated Solutions (GED) customers. As the only online source for genuine OEM parts for GED machinery, The GED Store provides significant value.

“The real value to our customer is their ability to order from our over 8,500 in stock OEM parts with 24/7 access. No longer do they need to wait for an available representative or save up orders for first shift,” says Bradly Duguay, Director of Customer Service at GED. “Pricing, as well as an abundance of other product information, is readily available all the time.”

GED’s value-added service department will be located in booth #1935 where show attendees can register for an online account and receive a free t-shirt with their first order.

Key features GED’s customers are excited to use include ordering with PO or credit card, wishlists for buying approval, full order history, and multiple ways to identify the right part for your machine.

The best feature of all is that GED’s outstanding Tech Support team is still on call and available. With over 70 years of combined industry experience our Support team can provide useful preventive maintenance information, step by step troubleshooting, and part identification.
