Sponsored by Window & Door magazine, the coveted annual awards recognize significant innovations in window and door technology, manufacturing and marketing. “Window and door manufacturers are constantly pushing the boundaries in terms of function and style; suppliers are likewise evolving to provide them the tools they need to do so effectively,” says Emily Thompson, editor, Window & Door magazine.  “The Crystal Achievement Awards recognize such companies whose commitment to innovation stands to elevate the entire industry.” This recognition marks GED’s eleventh Crystal Achievement Award.

The new Intercept 2.5 is GED’s next generation of the proven Intercept technology compliment to the i-3 Intercept System and replaces its Intercept GEN I and GEN II Systems.  It combines the workhorse attitude of the former Intercept GEN II with the technological advances of the i-3 Intercept and affords industry professionals an ease of transition, operation and maintenance along with improved productivity.

Manufacturers will recognize the familiar footprint while welcoming the very latest state-of-the-art technologies and enhancements that seamlessly enables the machine to now switch between Intercept ULTRA Stainless, ThinPlate® and Blackline® materials.

A new state-of-the-art Control System affords operator and maintenance familiarity and includes Windows 7, WinIG 4/5 compatibility; significant hardware/cable reduction and improved/remote diagnostics. Additionally, the 2.5 offers improved coil feed and handling; position width clamping with anti-drift monitoring for consistent quality production and quick-release tooling for reduced maintenance time.  The newly designed Servo Corner Crimper ensures consistent spacer folding with substantially reduced maintenance requirements. With the new high-speed Corner Crimper, this system performs 15% faster than previous generations.

Since its inception, Intercept’s technology works with a variety of materials. The 2.5 continues that capability and is compatible with various sealants, metals and desiccant options, whether producing a single or dual seal.
