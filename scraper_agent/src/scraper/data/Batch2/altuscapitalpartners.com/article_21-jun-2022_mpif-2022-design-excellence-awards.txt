MPIF 2022 Design Excellence Awards

Nichols Portland, Inc., won three awards of distinction in the 2022 PM Design Excellence Awards Competition that was announced on Monday, June 13th.

In the Automotive—Engine Category for Conventional PM components, an Award of Distinction has been given to Nichols Portland LLC, a division of Nichols Portland Inc., for an eccentric ring used in a variable displacement oil pump. The sinter-hardened parts provide enhanced performance compared with prior generation designs that used steam-treated as-sintered parts.

In the Industrial Motors/Controls & Hydraulics Category for Conventional PM components, an Award of Distinction has been given to Nichols Portland LLC, a division of Nichols Portland Inc., for a pump head sub-assembly for fluid delivery. The assembly comprises six PM parts, an inlet plate, eccentric ring, inner and outer gerotors, a spline coupling, and an outlet plate.

In the Lawn & Garden/Off-Highway Conventional PM components Category, an Award of Distinction has been given to Alpha Precision Group, a division of Nichols Portland Inc., for a camshaft assembly used in a family of engines ranging from 19–27 hp for consumer lawn & garden machines. The assembly comprises six PM components (a cam gear, four cam lobes, and a thrust washer). All five parts are assembled to the precision ground shaft by means of highly automated, specialized assembly cells.
