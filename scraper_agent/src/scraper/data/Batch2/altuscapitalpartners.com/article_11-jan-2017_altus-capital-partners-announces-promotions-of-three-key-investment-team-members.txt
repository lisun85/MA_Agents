Mr. Groh earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, an MPA from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, and a BBA from the Western Michigan University Haworth College of Business. He also serves on the Board of Prism Plastics, Inc.

As Vice President, Mr. deMarco will be responsible for sourcing, strategic analysis, market research, underwriting, due diligence, closing new investments and assisting in managing existing portfolios. Before joining Altus in 2016, Mr. deMarco was part of the investment teams at Pillsman Partners and The Beekman Group, where he focused on control investments in middle market businesses across a range of industries. Previously, he was an Assistant Vice President at GE Capital, where he spent six years leading growth equity, venture capital, and senior debt investments in the energy and manufacturing sectors. Prior to that, Mr. deMarco was part of GE’s Corporate Audit Staff where he focused on improving operations and processes across GE’s global industrial businesses. He started his career at GE Aircraft Engines where he had multiple operating roles in engineering, manufacturing, and finance.
