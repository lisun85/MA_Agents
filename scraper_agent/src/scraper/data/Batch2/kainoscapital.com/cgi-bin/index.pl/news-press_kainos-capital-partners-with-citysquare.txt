Kainos Capital Partners with CitySquare
February 19, 2022

Dallas, TX – Kainos Capital has recently partnered with CitySquare, a local non-profit organization offering a comprehensive array of social services that address four key areas related to the persistence of poverty: hunger, health, housing, and hope. Its social service programs provide more than 50,000 human touches in Dallas and Paris, Texas.

This month, the Firm spent time at CitySquare’s Food Pantry, providing groceries to 170 families and bagging over 7,000 lbs of food. The Food Pantry operates on a first-come, first-served basis to provide fresh groceries, nutritious meals, and pet products to families and children. These efforts reduce food waste and contribute to fighting the battle to end hunger. Food security is only one of the local impacts CitySquare and its volunteers have on the Dallas community. Over the Holiday season, the Kainos team collected new unwrapped toys and winter clothes for CitySquare, helping ensure those experiencing homelessness were prepared for the unpredictable cold weather and had accessible resources during the Holiday season.

Kainos is dedicated to committing our time and resources to address homelessness, poverty, and hunger affecting the Dallas community through local partnerships like CitySquare.
