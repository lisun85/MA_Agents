North Texas Food Bank COVID-19 Response
April 16, 2020

 

Dallas, TX – In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, the North Texas Food Bank has flipped its business model to serve the dramatic increase in needs in the North Texas community. The Food Bank has been packing ~60K emergency family meal boxes each week that include 25-27 lbs of shelf stable product and a kitted 15-lb boxes of produce that will provide 21 meals. These boxes are being delivered to NTFB partner agencies across the 13-county service area and are also being distributed at mobile drive-thru distributions. In order to comply with the CDC guidelines, and out of safety for both their volunteers and the community they serve, the NTFB has cancelled all traditional volunteer shifts until further notice. In the meantime, 262 members of the Texas National Guard have been activated to help ensure that hungry North Texans have access to food during these uncertain times. These members come from all over the state and serve in the 56th Brigade. They are on our production floor, warehouse, mobile distributions and helping out at some of the NTFB Partner Agencies.

As corporate sponsor, board member, and partner, Kainos is proud to support the NTFB’s important mission. As traditional volunteer shifts have been curtailed during this time, Kainos will be sponsoring meals for the employees and workers onsite in the coming weeks, and we will continue to support the needs of the NTFB and the community it serves during this critical time.
