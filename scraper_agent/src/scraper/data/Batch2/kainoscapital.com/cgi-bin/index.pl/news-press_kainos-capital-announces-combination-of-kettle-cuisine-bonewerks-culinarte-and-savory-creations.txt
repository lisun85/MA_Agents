Dallas, TX – Kainos Capital today announced the combination of three of its portfolio companies – Kettle Cuisine, Bonewerks Culinarte, and Savory Creations – into one business, which will operate as Kettle Cuisine. In addition, Kettle Cuisine has acquired the frozen soup business of NORPAC Foods Inc., an Oregon- based farmer-owned cooperative.

Kettle Cuisine will maintain the Bonewerks, Savory Creations, and Soup Supreme trade brands in the marketplace. The company is headquartered in Lynn, MA, with an expanded manufacturing footprint that includes four production sites across the United States: Lynn, MA, Morgan Hill, CA, Union City, CA and Green Bay, WI.

Daniel Hopkin, a partner at Kainos Capital said, “The newly expanded Kettle Cuisine platform is positioned to serve an exciting intersection of consumer preferences for convenient, fresh food. At the same time, the combined company will even better meet operator needs for a supplier partner that can provide collaborative, chef-driven product development, redundant scale manufacturing, and the commitment to food safety and culinary principles that are the foundation of our brands.”

Liam McClennon, CEO of Kettle Cuisine, said, “For more than three decades, Kettle has stood for artisan-quality clean label soups, sauces, and side dishes serving a growing customer base across the retail and foodservice channels. The addition of Bonewerks and Savory Creations to the portfolio, as well as the NORPAC soup business, adds several outstanding brands that share these core principles. We are proud to expand our product offering to include sous vide entrees, demi-glace, broths, and other specialty sauces, enabling us to bring more comprehensive meal solutions to our customers.”

Mr. McClennon continued, “As a result of our growth over the years, we are fortunate to be able to hire many new team members, provide promotional opportunities to our employees, and share our increased confidence that Kettle Cuisine is a great place to build a career. We are pleased to now welcome the Bonewerks and Savory Creations team members to Kettle Cuisine and for them to share in our exciting future.”
