Madison, N.J. – (BUSINESS WIRE)– Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, the makers of America’s most-preferred bone health supplement brand, Caltrate®, today announced the launch of Caltrate® Bone & Joint Health, a new, once-daily supplement.

“According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) 54 million adults living in the U.S., who are 50 years and older, are affected by osteoporosis and low bone mass,3 and many seek to support both their bone health and joint flexibility to maintain an active lifestyle,” said Elizabeth Ward, M.S., R.D., Registered Dietitian and nutrition health expert. “A once-daily supplement that contains calcium, vitamins C and D, minerals like zinc, copper and manganese, and UC-II®, allows consumers to get the nutrients that are critical to help maintain strong bones and support flexible joints.”
