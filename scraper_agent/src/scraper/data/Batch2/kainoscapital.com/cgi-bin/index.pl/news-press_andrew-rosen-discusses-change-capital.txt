Andrew Rosen discusses “Change Capital”
June 4, 2020

Kainos Capital was co-founded by Andrew Rosen in 2012. Since that time, the firm’s primary goal has been to take an operationally oriented and hands-on approach with management teams to drive growth and build companies of strategic value.

Change Capital-based operating strategies are developed with Kainos Capital’s partner companies to increase the sales and profitability and optimize the assets of each company. This active strategy requires intense operational focus and action.

According to founder Andrew Rosen, “… we measure success not so much in the return on capital that we generated, but really in the performance of the portfolio companies the we’ve had the benefit and privilege to be associated with.”
