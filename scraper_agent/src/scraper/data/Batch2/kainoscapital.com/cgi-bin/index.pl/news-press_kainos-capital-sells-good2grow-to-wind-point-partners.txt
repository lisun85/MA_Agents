Transaction Builds on Kainos Capital’s History of Driving Transformational Growth

 

Dallas, TX – Kainos Capital (“Kainos”), a food and consumer-focused private equity firm, announced today that it has sold its portfolio company good2grow to Wind Point Partners.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, good2grow is a branded kids’ beverage company that sells clean label, ready-to-drink fruit juice, fortified water and organic flavored milk. Kainos partnered with the business, which was previously founder-owned, in 2018.

Andrew Rosen, Managing Partner of Kainos, said, “good2grow is a great example of the transformational growth that Kainos seeks in each investment. Early on, we identified better-for-you and convenience as attractive investment themes in our sector, and we were drawn to good2grow’s unique product offering that provides entertaining beverages that meet kids’ nutritional needs. In just three years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic environment, the good2grow management team executed brilliantly on our Change Capital plan to nearly double revenue through expanded distribution, increased sales velocity and new product development.”

Bob Sperry, a Partner at Kainos, added, “By accelerating good2grow’s direct store distribution to nearly full national coverage, we significantly increased in-store display support for our retail partners. Additionally, we strategically expanded the brand from juice to fortified water and organic flavored milk during our ownership, providing more beverage options that kids love and parents feel good serving.”

“We chose to partner with the Kainos team in 2018 with the belief that their sector knowledge and network of relationships – in particular in the c-store channel – would be invaluable, and this proved to be true. They are a great team to work with, and they execute with speed and certainty.”
Gunnar Olson

CEO, good2grow

Gunnar Olson, CEO of good2grow, continued, “We chose to partner with the Kainos team in 2018 with the belief that their sector knowledge and network of relationships – in particular in the c-store channel – would be invaluable, and this proved to be true. They are a great team to work with, and they execute with speed and certainty.”

Rosen added, “good2grow has a world-class leadership team capable of managing a much larger enterprise and we are excited for the company’s next phase of growth under its new ownership.”

Robert W. Baird and Credit Suisse served as financial advisors to good2grow. Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP served as legal counsel to good2grow.
