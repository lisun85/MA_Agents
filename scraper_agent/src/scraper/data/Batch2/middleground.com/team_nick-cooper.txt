NICK COOPER
Vice President, Transaction Team

Nick is a Vice President on the Transaction Team. He earned his BBA in Finance and Marketing from the University of Kentucky, a Master of Accounting from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his CPA license. After starting his accounting career at Ernest & Young with clients in private equity, he realized that he was sitting on the wrong side of the table and transitioned into investment banking at Piper Jaffray. He would go on to work on investment teams at Cortec Group, Council Capital, and Frontline Healthcare Partners where he worked in all phases of the investment lifecycle.

Although Nick is a die-hard University of Kentucky sports fan as a third-generation alumnus, his allegiance to the Bluegrass State was tested when he packed up his bags and moved to New York City. Nick enjoyed city life for eight years before he realized a 600 sq ft apartment somehow wasn’t large enough to start a family. He and his wife searched for homes in Brooklyn, Connecticut, and even looked in New Jersey (bless their souls), before deciding to move back down south. Currently, Nick’s main hobby is being a dad to his ”absolute fireball” of a daughter, but he also enjoys unwinding with audiobooks (which he claims is a legitimate form of reading) and traveling (55+ countries visited and counting)! While Nick is looking forward to settling down in Kentucky, he is excited to share his love of exploring new places with his daughter.
