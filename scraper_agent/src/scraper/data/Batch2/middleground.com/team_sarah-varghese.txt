SARAH VARGHESE
Vice President, EU Transaction Team

Amsterdam, NL




Sarah is a Vice President on the EU Transaction Team based in Amsterdam. Sarah joined us from Harris Williams, where she worked on sell-side M&A. Sarah received her Bachelor of Science in Economics and Math from the University of Southern California, where she graduated Magna Cum Laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. She also received her Masters in Finance from Claremont McKenna College as a Robert Day Scholar.

Sarah’s list of academic honors is as long as the California sun, but that’s just half the story. When Sarah isn’t dazzling people with her frontal and parietal lobes, Sarah spends her time on her real passions, hiking and searching for the perfect bowl of ramen. (Something she shares with Yuji.) You don’t have to spend a lot of time with Sarah to figure out that she is very outgoing. Like many of the people in our office, Sarah enjoys food, and nothing is as good as a “dessert date” with friends. Sarah has an eye for detail and can frequently be found wandering the aisles at her local Whole Foods reading the label of everything on the shelf. She is such a regular that customers frequently confuse her for an employee. She probably knows more than most!
