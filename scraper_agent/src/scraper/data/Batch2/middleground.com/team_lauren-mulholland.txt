LAUREN MULHOLLAND
Partner, Operations and Transaction Team




Lauren is a Co-Founder, Partner, Member of the Investment Committee, and Women’s Wing Champion at MiddleGround. She acts as a leader on the Transaction and Operations Teams and is actively involved in transaction sourcing and investor relations. She started her career in investment banking as part of the Financial Institutions Group at Banc of America Securities and moved to Macquarie Capital to help launch a private capital markets platform. She subsequently worked at Monomoy Capital, where she was a Director on the investment team. Lauren received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tarheels!) as well as an MBA with Honors from Columbia Business School (go whatever Columbia’s mascot is!).

Lauren has been named among Buyouts Women in PE 10 Rock Stars Making Waves in Private Equity, added to PEI’s The Future 40 List, and named to Mergers & Acquisitions Most Influential Women in Mid-Market M&A. We are proud of Lauren’s accomplishments, but level her out over a quick game of FIFA Soccer, as she is the worst player in the NYC office.

Outside of the private equity industry, she commits her time to serving non-profit organizations. She serves on the Finance Committee for the Chordoma Foundation and sits on the Global Leadership Council and Board of Visitors for UNC-Chapel Hill. Lauren likes to spend her spare time golfing and she and her husband, Brian, are the proud parents of three girls, Maddie, Cece, and Ellie.
