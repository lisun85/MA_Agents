ALL TEAM MEMBERS
MONICA MCCLINTON
Partner, Chief Compliance Officer




Monica is a Partner & CCO and Head of Strategic Services with responsibilities for the back office. Additionally, Monica is a Member of the Investment Committee at MiddleGround. Monica was previously our CAO. Prior to MiddleGround, Monica was a Senior Compliance Specialist at Fiserv. Monica worked with John, Lauren, and Scot at their prior firm. Monica has a degree in Finance and Computer Information Systems from Georgia State University.

Monica was the first person we called when we started MiddleGround Capital and has been instrumental in the build-out of the organization. Monica is a real “foodie” although she admits that was much easier to be in New York City than in Lexington, Kentucky. She rarely finds food that is spicy enough for her and, if she does, everybody in the office knows to avoid it. Monica is a tough cookie, she seldom finds things up to her standards.
