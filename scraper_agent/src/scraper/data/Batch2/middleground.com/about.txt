OPERATORS

Our team is comprised of highly trained individuals who have over 230 years of collective experience working for world class organizations. Additionally, our operators have held a wide range of roles, from working on the shop floor as hourly production workers to working as executive managers in leadership positions at Fortune 100 companies.

We have been in your shoes. We understand the problems that face employees working in industrial businesses.

PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS

We bring private equity, consulting, investment banking, and capital markets experience to our portfolio companies. Our team has been trained and has extensive experience working for both bulge bracket and middle market firms, such as JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Harris Williams.

Collectively, we have held more than 40 Board of Director positions for middle-market businesses.

RELIABLE & ACTIVE PARTNERS

When our management teams do well, our investors do well. Our portfolio company management teams are critical in developing and refining the customized value creation program we execute and they are fully aligned with our goals. We tailor a compensation program for each company that incentivizes management to maximize equity value creation.

TRANSACTION FLEXIBILITY

We know that no two transactions are alike and that your business is different. We work with sellers to structure an investment that works for both sides. We move quickly and efficiently.

WHAT’S IN A NAME?

At MiddleGround, we don’t believe that a good business relationship is one where someone has to lose for others to win. We believe there is a middle ground in every situation where everyone wins. As a result, we operate with transparency and respect while expecting superior results.

In addition, some of us (mostly John) are avid1 fisherman and have explored the Florida Middle Grounds on numerous occasions. The Middle Grounds are a collection of natural reefs 99 miles NNW of Tampa Bay, Florida. Although out of reach for all but the most dedicated fisherman, a bounty in the form of a plentiful catch rewards those daring enough to make the trip.

Our operationally focused approach to the lower middle market, combined with a partnership and respect for management, allows us to find superior value where others cannot.

1 In this example, “avid” does not mean to infer any level of actual competence, just a passion for doing something he is really not that good at over and over again.
