ALL TEAM MEMBERS
TROY GONZALES
Director, Operations




Troy is a Director on the Operating Team. Prior to joining us, Troy worked as an interim management professional for various portfolio companies at the prior firm with John and Scot. Prior to these positions, Troy spent over 28 years in the plant operations and change management industries, including stints at MillerCoors, Dean Foods, and Otis Spunkmeyer.

Troy is the unsung hero of the firm. He is frequently sent to underperforming plants to work with management on financial and process improvement. Sorry but if Troy is at your plant, “you are an under performer”.  In his spare time, Troy likes to relax by shooting things, things that are far far away. Troy spends a lot of time on the road and has become a connoisseur of fast food restaurants and drinks more Red Bull than anybody ever should.
