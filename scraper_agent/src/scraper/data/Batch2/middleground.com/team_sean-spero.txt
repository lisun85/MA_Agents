SEAN SPERO
Vice President, Business Development




Sean is a Vice President on our Business Development team. He joins us from Plexus Capital where he was a VP, responsible for new deal sourcing and relationship building in support of the firm’s credit-led independent sponsor strategy. Prior to that, Sean spent several years working in the Corporate Development function at Syneos Health, where he gained valuable experience executing a variety of M&A transactions in the life sciences industry. Sean began his career within Cisco’s finance and leadership development program (LIFT). He joins our growing list of Tar Heel alumni (Go Heels!), having graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a BA in Economics.

Though originally from South Florida, Sean’s family relocated to North Carolina when he was young. Once Raleigh got its first and only professional sports team, he quickly developed a passion for ice hockey. After spending his high school years at a boarding school in upstate New York, he went on to play junior and semi-pro in various leagues throughout New England and Canada (and yes, believe it or not, he still has all his teeth intact!). When Sean isn’t dropping the gloves, you’ll likely find him spending quality time outdoors (or cuddled up on the couch) with his wife, Samantha, and their Pitbull, Cash (aka C.R.E.A.M.).
