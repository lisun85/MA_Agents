We are impressed by the success these businesses have realized to date and look forward to expanding on their growth as well as identifying incremental opportunities for the company’s expansion under our ownership.”

PVI serves as a critical link in its supply chain and is a true value-added partner to both its customers and suppliers. We are excited to partner with the PVI management team to invest in organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will continue to expand the company’s value proposition,” added Vice President Marty Sjoquist.

expertise, passion for continuous improvement, and believe they are the perfect owner for PVI’s next phase of growth.”
