LINDSAY QUINTERO
Vice President, Transaction Team




Lindsay is a Vice President on the Transaction Team. Lindsay joined us from Harris Williams where she spent two years as a healthcare investment banker focused on M&A transactions. Lindsay received her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the Farmer Business School at Miami University, of Ohio.

Lindsay grew up just outside Cleveland, Ohio and is a middle child with three siblings. Like most people in Cleveland, she dreamed of attending “The Ohio State University” and watching LeBron build a basketball dynasty with the Cavs. Instead, she ended up attending Miami University because she left out the “The” in her application to Ohio State and watched LeBron go to Hollywood. While Lindsay now resides in the trendy Soho neighborhood, she frequently chooses to sleep on the free sofa we adopted in our New York office. A self-described “foodie”, she is also on a mission to find a cheese + charcuterie board in Manhattan that Lauren hasn’t found yet.
