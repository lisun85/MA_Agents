ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ALEX VAN DER HAVE
Head of Europe

Amsterdam, NL




Alex is the Managing Director (MD) and Head of the EU Transaction Team in our Amsterdam office. He joined us with 15+ years of experience in banking/investment and his most recent role was as MD of Private Equity and Venture Capital at Ingka Investments (AKA the corporate investment arm of Ikea). Alex holds a degree in Corporate Law from Erasmus University in addition to his MBA from IE Business School. MiddleGround won him over with our entrepreneurial spirit and casual culture that sets us apart from other firms (and means we can wear t-shirts instead of suits, thank goodness).   

Outside of the office, Alex’s life revolves around family, food, and sport – a picture of suburbia! He has three children (he describes his son as a carbon copy of himself) and he loves to spend time playing soccer and field hockey with them. While he loves food, his wife is the better cook. Alex SAYS he takes on a sous chef role… but she would sooner describe him as the dishwasher.
