ALEX STEWART
Vice President, Office Management




Alex is the Head of Administrative Services and prior to MiddleGround worked in medical coding. Alex has a Bachelor’s degree in health sciences and a minor in public health from University of South Florida.

Alex is an avid reality TV fan and truly tells it like it is, something that comes in handy as John’s daughter in law. She is the unofficial cookie baker for our corporate events (remember the Fish shaped cookies) and enjoys trying new recipes. She also is the official baker of Southern Barker’s birthday cakes (get yours at www.southerbarker.com) Alex spends her free time with her husband John II (John’s oldest son), travelling the world with John and his family (it turns out some people can’t get enough John in their lives, something the rest of have a hard time imagining) and chasing their two kids Elliot and Emilia..
