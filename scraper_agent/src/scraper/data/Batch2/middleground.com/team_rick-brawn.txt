RICK BRAWN
Managing Director, Operations




Rick is a Managing Director of Operations at MiddleGround, where he works with the firm’s portfolio companies on executing operational initiatives and performs diligence on investment opportunities. Rick brings over 25 years of aviation and diversified industrial manufacturing experience, and 6 years of middle market private equity experience. Rick is known for creating high performing teams, driving commercial excellence, and improving operations.

Outside of work, Rick loves to spend time with his wife, Heather, and four adult children when they are home. Rick has lived all over the world and specifically in Asia, where he picked up a love for karaoke. He has been known to get behind the karaoke mic after tipping a few back thus being awarded the nickname ‘Whiskey Rick.’ We’re hoping to turn him into a ‘Bourbon Brawn,’ in true Kentucky spirit!
