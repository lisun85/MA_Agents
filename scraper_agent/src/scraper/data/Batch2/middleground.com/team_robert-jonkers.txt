ROBERT JONKERS
Managing Director, Head of EU Operations Team

Amsterdam, NL




Robert joined our Amsterdam office as the Managing Director, Head of EU Operations Team to share his wealth of knowledge in supply chain optimization. Robert brings a unique combination of hands-on operational experience with leadership roles in McKinsey & Company’s supply chain practice, where he focused on elevating supply chain organizations and networks to unlock the strategic potential as a critical enabler of overall business performance. Prior to his time at McKinsey, Robert held senior positions at Nature’s Pride and PON amongst others. Over the course of his career, he has developed an invaluable skillset across verticals and his deep knowledge about operational value creations is an ideal lead for MiddleGround’s Operations team in Europe.  

Robert spends much of his free time coaching field hockey, we wonder if he approaches it with the same end-to-end perspective he applies to operational transformations… we’re unsure if his children’s teams would have a high adoption of lean operations on the field. We’re also hoping with Robert on the team, we have finally filled the roster for our MiddleGround band! He plays the guitar, saxophone, as well as the piano.
