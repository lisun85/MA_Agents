AARON SHAPIRO
Director, Accounting Team




Aaron is a Director on the Accounting Team. He has not one, but THREE degrees: a BS in Economics from James Madison University, JD from The University of Alabama, and an LL.M in Taxation from Northwestern University. Aaron began his career working in PwC’s International and M&A tax strategies practice in Washington, D.C. office before relocating to Florida to focus on middle-market clients. In 2017, he joined Primo Water Corporation, where he led tax planning for over 40 acquisitions and divestitures.

Though he’ll miss the Florida sunshine, the opportunity to join MiddleGround felt like the perfect step for him and his growing family. Aaron was excited to trade Tampa for a quieter lifestyle in Lexington —but his wife needed some convincing! When Aaron’s not refining tax strategies, you’ll find him flexing his culinary skills on his “prized” outdoor grill or whipping up baked goods from scratch. Outside the kitchen, Aaron trains Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is an avid traveler, with work taking him to global tax hubs like Luxembourg and personal passions for the outdoors taking him to ski resorts and national parks around the country.
