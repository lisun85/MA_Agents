ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ROLAND VELDHUIJZEN VAN ZANTEN
Director, EU Transaction Team

Amsterdam, NL




Roland is a Director on our EU Transaction Team based in Amsterdam. He holds his master’s degree in Financial Economics from the Erasmus School of Economics in addition to his bachelor’s in International Business from VU University. Prior to MiddleGround, Roland worked with Credit Suisse where he advised on M&A, IPO, and financing transactions before spending six years with PE firm, Gimv where he would ultimately become Principal, focusing on sustainable energy, infrastructure, industrials, and logistics investments. In addition to his traditional experience, he participated in internship exchange opportunities that took him to Buenos Aires and the Congo! 

Joining our Amsterdam team brings Roland closer to home, he was born just 20 minutes from Amsterdam to a big family… made up of entirely doctors. While he’s the black sheep for choosing a profession in finance, the positive is that he rarely goes to a doctor’s office since family dinners bring most specialties under one roof. In his free time, Roland enjoys playing sports and used to be a strong field hockey player. Roland grew up in the Netherlands but because he has two passports (Dutch and Swedish) he qualified for the Swedish national field hockey team!! He might’ve played five matches for Sweden during the championship, but he lost out when he didn’t know their national anthem (oops!)… we’ll forgive you though, Roland.
