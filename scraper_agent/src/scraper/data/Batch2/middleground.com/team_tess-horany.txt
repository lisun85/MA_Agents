ALL TEAM MEMBERS
TESS HORANY
Vice President, Marketing




Tess is Vice President of our Marketing Team. Originally from Dallas, Texas, she attended the University of Texas at Austin (Go Longhorns!!) where she received her BBA in Marketing and a certificate in digital art/media. Prior to joining MiddleGround Capital, she worked as a Social Media Manager at Texas Instruments and Transmission, a B2B marketing agency.

Tess certainly brings a creative flair to our team! In her spare time you can find her taking art classes or watching her favorite films by Paul Thomas Anderson, Hayao Miyazaki, and Wes Anderson while cooking up (healthy-ish) meals. She also has some hidden talents up her sleeve! Tess is an avid scuba diver, margarita mixing master, and is a self-proclaimed makeup artist (maybe she could do face painting at our next MGC team event, we’d love to see Scot with some contouring)! Tess also joins the ranks of proud pet parents at the firm and has a corgi named Leonard Bojangles Dobby Kennedy (aka Lenny)!
