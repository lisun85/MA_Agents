ALICIA MOTOMURA
Director, Operations Team




Alicia is a Director on our Operations Team. She joined us from Mubea where she acted as General Manager, Powertrain North America. Prior to Mubea, Alicia held a Quality Manager position at Benteler Automotive where she gained over 11 years of experience across a variety of roles.   

Despite Alicia working at MiddleGround, where nearly all employees are die-hard UK Cats fans, you can find her cheering for the Ohio State Buckeyes during football season. If you’re in the office and you hear someone randomly break out into song, there’s a decent chance it’s Alicia (or Rick Brawn, they are the resident karaoke masters). You can usually find Alicia jamming to Journey, or anything Classic Rock.
