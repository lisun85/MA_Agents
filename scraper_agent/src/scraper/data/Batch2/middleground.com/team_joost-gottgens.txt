JOOST GOTTGENS
Vice President, EU Operations Team

Amsterdam, NL

Joost is a Vice President of Operations on our Amsterdam team, and brings extensive experience within operations and private equity to the role. He worked within manufacturing and construction sectors during his time with Monitor Deloitte and delved into with portco management as the Senior Manager of Operations at Aurelius Group, where he was a one-man operations team. Most recently, he acted as the Associate Partner on the Deal Strategy Team with EY-Parthenon.     

Joost thrives being on site where he can see his impact in person; though travel will be more challenging now that he has two children! His family lead a picturesque life in a village east of Amsterdam; there’s even a massive forest at the end of their street where he hikes with his family. We use the term “hiking” loosely when it comes to the kids, his son usually needs to be carried after the first hour. He’s also a vintage car fanatic and member of the Goodwood racing club, often traveling to rallies, and driving his own vintage vehicles (but he’s better at taking the cars apart than putting them back together… relying on his friends in car restoration for that part).
