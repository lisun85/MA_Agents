OUR TEAM
WE ARE MOST PROUD OF THE TEAM WE HAVE BUILT

People don’t work for businesses, people work for people. At MiddleGround, we are creating a culture that relies on participative management to empower and motivate each other. We want a team that is motivated to make the best decisions and that means everyone having the flexibility to participate based on their capability, not their title. We think it works pretty well.

Our Commitment to DE&I:

The diversity of MiddleGround employees is one of our greatest strengths. DE&I efforts are a part of our strategic plan developed and initiated by the Founding Partners and supported by our entire team. We believe that possessing a multi-cultural and gender diverse team is essential for making good business decisions, and key decisions for the MiddleGround Portfolio must be achieved through consensus. We celebrate the diverse experiences and backgrounds of our teammates, and aim to incorporate those values with an inclusive and equitable interview and recruiting process. We encourage our employees to bring their full selves to work, because embracing diversity of our employees makes us better together.
