Mantel Precision is a manufacturer of ultra-complex machined and fabricated materials. Mantel’s relentless focus on quality is a key differentiator, especially given that many of its products are used in mission-critical end markets such as robotics, avionics, aerospace and defense, medical equipment, and optomechanics.

Mantel Precision products are produced and marketed through two prominent brands: Megatech and Advantage Metal Products (AMP). Megatech is based in Quebec City and is a leader in ultra-precision machining and rapid prototyping for complex components. AMP is based in Livermore, California, and is a large-scale production facility specializing in cutting-edge sheet metal and machining technology.
