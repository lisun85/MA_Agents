MATT WEIR
Director, Operations Team




Matt is a Director of Operations; he has his Mechanical Engineering Bachelor’s from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in addition to an MBA and a Master’s of Engineering from the University of Michigan. He managed HEVEV operations with Delphi at the start of his career but spent nearly 18 years with Parker Hannifin, a diversified industrial company. His experience varied from improving financially distressed plants, to sales leadership, to acting as a General Manager that consolidated several divisions and implemented Lean fundamentals. We’re lucky to have Matt’s extensive operations experience on our team. 

Because Matt is a pastor’s son, he moved frequently while growing up, and experienced both big and small-town lifestyles. When he raised his own family, he gravitated toward the small-town pace of Charlotte. He appreciates that there’s fewer bad influences and says that “the worst thing that can happen here is your kid stepping in a cow patty”. Matt knows this from experience, he personally had some traumatizing experiences with farm animals… when he was in the 5th grade his foot was in a cast due to a broken ankle. Because goats are bottle fed, they thought the toes poking out of the cast were the tips of a feeding bottle… and Matt ended up with hickeys on his toes… bet you weren’t expecting that in a Director’s biography!
