JENNIFER COHAGEN
Vice President Fund Accounting, Accounting Team




Jennifer is our Vice President of Fund Accounting and joined us from Stonehenge Capital where she was the Assistant Director of Compliance. Jen graduated from The Ohio State University with a BS in Economics, Women’s Studies. She also received her Masters in Accounting from Keller Graduate School of Management of DeVry University.

Like Alicia Motomura, Jen is also another brave Buckeyes fan, surrounded by a ton of UK Cats fan. When she’s not rooting for the Buckeyes, Jen enjoys traveling and fully immersing herself in the culture of new places!
