The Rockwood Growth System in Action

Sector:  Industrials

Situation

The founder and president of Impact Plastics sought a partner to provide the resources and expertise to grow the business and build out the team while he transitioned away from day to day operations. Rockwood was attracted to the business for multiple reasons, including: (1) its strong company culture and supporting leadership team; (2) its leadership in a niche market with stable, long-term demand trends; and (3) a nearly 20-year history of consistent annual growth and product innovation supported by a strong pipeline of actionable new growth opportunities.

Growth Plan

Rockwood and management had a shared vision of transforming the business into an institutional quality organization with a diverse base of recurring revenue, a clear and understandable value proposition to customers, and a defined strategy roadmap to create value for shareholders, customers and employees. To that end, Rockwood implemented a series of systems, processes and strategic investments to add significant value to the Company.
