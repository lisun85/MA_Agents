Annual roundup highlights the private equity and venture capital firms with successful track records backing entrepreneurs

Granite Creek today announced that it was named to Inc’s List of Founder-Friendly Investors for the fourth consecutive year. The Inc. Founder-Friendly Investors list honors the private equity and venture capital firms with the top track records backing entrepreneur-led businesses. The final list recognizes 218 firms which entrepreneurs have reported as collaborative and built to support the cultures of founder-led businesses.

“Granite Creek is proud to receive this recognition by Inc. for the fourth year in a row,” said Jim Clark, Partner at Granite Creek Capital Partners. “Our team has been partnering with entrepreneurial business leaders since 2005, placing great importance on supporting founders in their efforts to accelerate growth for their companies.”

Granite Creek provides its portfolio companies with a wide range of resources including strategy consultation, business development, market intelligence, acquisition support, banking relationships, and operational best practices.

“Now more than ever, founder-led companies need financing partners that offer guidance, expertise, and understanding—not just capital. These are the private equity, venture capital, and debt firms that have founders’ backs when it comes to accelerating growth,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. Business Media.

To compile the list, Inc. went straight to the source: entrepreneurs who have sold to private equity and venture capital firms. Founders filled out a questionnaire about their experiences partnering with private equity, venture capital, and debt firms and shared data on how their portfolio companies have grown during these partnerships.

Introduced in 2019, the Founder-Friendly Investors list quickly established itself as one of Inc.’s most resourceful franchises. It has become a go-to guide for entrepreneurs who want to grow their companies while retaining an ownership stake.

The November 2023 issue of Inc. magazine is available online now at https://www.inc.com/magazine and will be on newsstands beginning October 31.
