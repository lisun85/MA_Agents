A post-pandemic revival is boosting the food service industry. But diners want more than just the regular old night out, and a new category of “eatertainment” restaurants is fusing dining and sports to meet this demand.

Meet Pinstripes Inc., which is merging with a special purpose acquisition company Banyan Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: BYN). Once the merger is finalized, the Northbrook, Il.-based company will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PNST. The company offers activities such as bowling and bocce, making it an attractive destination for a wide range of patrons including corporate clients who make up almost 50% of revenue.

Unlike many companies that have gone public through SPAC mergers, Pinstripes is profitable. The company currently operates in 14 locations in the U.S., with an additional five venues under construction. Its newest location in Canoga Park, Ca., occupies over 30,000 square feet, introducing made-from-scratch Italian-American cuisine, fine wines and cocktails, bowling lanes, bocce courts and customizable private event and meeting spaces.
