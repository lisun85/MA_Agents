Annual roundup highlights the private equity, venture capital, and lenders with track records of backing founder-led companies

CHICAGO, Illinois, October 30, 2024 — Granite Creek Capital Partners, L.L.C., a private investment firm based in Chicago, today announced that it was named to Inc’s List of Founder-Friendly Investors for the fifth consecutive year.  The Inc. Founder-Friendly Investors list honors the private equity and venture capital firms with the top track records backing entrepreneur-led businesses. The final list recognizes firms that entrepreneurs have reported as collaborative and built to support the cultures of founder-led businesses. 

The prestigious list celebrates the investors who believe in backing founder-led businesses and helping them thrive. All companies on the list have successful track records of collaboration and remain actively involved with the businesses they invest in.

“Granite Creek is proud to receive this recognition by Inc. for the fifth year in a row,” said Brian Boorstein, Co-Founder and Partner at Granite Creek Capital Partners. “Our team has been partnering with entrepreneurial business leaders since 2005, placing great importance on supporting founders in their efforts to accelerate growth for their companies.”

Granite Creek provides its portfolio companies with a wide range of resources including strategy consultation, business development, market intelligence, acquisition support, banking relationships, and operational best practices.

“It has been a complicated few years for growth companies and the companies that fund them,” said Mike Hofman, editor-in-chief of Inc. “So we are happy to share with our readers the best, latest guidance on which venture capital firms, private equity firms, and growth-capital lenders have the track record and reputation of being especially good partners to founders and CEOs.”

To compile the list, Inc. went straight to the source: entrepreneurs who have sold to private equity and venture capital firms. Founders filled out a questionnaire about their experiences partnering with private equity, venture capital, and debt firms and shared data on how their portfolio companies have grown during these partnerships.

Introduced in 2019, the Founder-Friendly Investors list quickly established itself as one of Inc.’s most resourceful franchises. It has become a go-to guide for entrepreneurs who want to grow their companies while retaining an ownership stake.

The November 2024 issue of Inc. magazine is available online now at https://www.inc.com/magazine and will be on newsstands beginning October 29.
