CHICAGO and OTTUMWA, Iowa, Sept. 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Granite Creek Capital Partners, L.L.C., a private investment firm based in Chicago, today announced it has partnered with Equivu Capital, LLC (“Equivu”) on an investment in C&C Manufacturing, LLC (“C&C”). C&C is a leading manufacturer and distributor of heavy equipment, providing high-quality machinery to the scrap metal recycling, waste management, and airport maintenance equipment markets alongside a suite of aftermarket replacement parts and value-added services.

As part of the transaction, Equivu, the investment arm of entrepreneur Salvatore Calvino, has acquired a majority stake in C&C. In addition, Calvino was named CEO of C&C Manufacturing.

Granite Creek and Equivu’s investments, along with Calvino’s leadership, will enable C&C to capitalize on strong customer demand for its market-leading products through increased working capital investment, broadening its employee base and management team, and expanding its parts and services offerings.
