Granite Creek portfolio company, Salem One, has been named a Fast Track Leader for growth in the wide format industry by Wide Format Impressions Magazine! This year, Salem One earned the #56 spot on the magazine’s annual list of the Top 150 Wide Format Producers in the U.S. and Canada—an incredible milestone! Salem One has seen over 412.1% growth in wide format sales.

When it comes to growth and success, Salem One doesn’t necessarily feel like it needs to reinvent the wheel. In fact, Phil Kelley, president and CEO, notes, “Salem One is proud to ‘be a printer’ and loves the manufacturing — what we call execution — side of our company.”

That said, he also notes that “the old view of quality, service, and price are all now table stakes in execution. Strategic expertise and consumer-focused outcomes are the basis of our relationships.”
