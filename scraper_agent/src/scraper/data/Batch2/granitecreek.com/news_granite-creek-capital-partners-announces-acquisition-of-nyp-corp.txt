Granite Creek Capital Partners Announces Acquisition of NYP Corp.
NOVEMBER 14, 2023

Granite Creek today announced its acquisition of NYP, LLC, d/b/a NYP Corp. (“NYP” or the “Company”), a New Jersey-based value-added packaging manufacturer and distributor focused on the wholesale nursery, agricultural, and industrial markets.

Since its humble beginnings in burlap packaging in 1946, NYP has grown and thrived under multiple generations of family management. Long-time owner-operators Christopher and Jerry LaBelle bring unique knowledge, energy, and leadership to the business, having learned under their father, Gerald LaBelle, co-founder of NYP, during his multiple decades at the Company’s helm.

As part of the transaction, experienced industry executive Robert Dahl was named CEO of NYP, as well as Chairman of the Board.

“NYP is deeply committed to its customers, employees, and other partners,” said Dahl. “With Granite Creek’s support, I look forward to working hand in hand with the NYP team to drive continued growth at the Company and to maintain the highest standards of quality and service.”

“

Chris and Jerry’s commitment to the success of NYP, its associates, and the satisfaction of its customers is a true testament to NYP’s founding principles of pride and integrity. We are excited to support NYP in this next phase of growth, product diversification, and expansion.”
