Granite Creek, a US-based private investment firm, has expanded its animal health portfolio with its funding of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Solutions’ acquisition of Diamond Animal Health.

Granite Creek has unveiled that it has grown its footprint in the animal health market through its recent funding of Veterinary Pharmaceutical Solutions’ (VPS) acquisition of Diamond Animal Health. Granite Creek supported VPS’ acquisition of Diamond through a follow-on investment from its FlexCap II fund, executing on the firm’s continued pursuit of animal health investment opportunities.

Granite Creek purchased VPS, a licensed animal compounding pharmacy focused on supporting the veterinary community in 2020, and has actively supported the company in driving growth through strategic investments in human capital, new product development, and facility expansion. According to the firm, the Diamond acquisition represents the first of many planned platform additions as the company looks to expand its capabilities and market reach.

Granite Creek worked closely with VPS leadership through the acquisition of Diamond, a contract manufacturer and researcher of animal vaccines and pharmaceuticals that are utilized by veterinarians of production and companion animals. The combined business provides a full suite of solutions to meet veterinarians’ needs while remaining a valuable partner to other pharmaceutical and biological companies working with Diamond to manufacture their products. Granite Creek added that VPS and Diamond’s combined pharmacy, chemistry, quality, and regulatory capabilities uniquely position the company for rapid innovation.

“We view production animal health as an attractive end-market. Innovative companies in this sector are critical in supporting stable protein sources for consumers while ensuring efficiency and safety in the supply chain. The combination of VPS and Diamond creates an integrated partner with the capabilities and capacity to continue bringing innovative solutions to the market,” said Mike Ray, Operating Partner at Granite Creek.

“VPS’ acquisition of Diamond Animal Health is the first of many planned platform additions as the company looks to expand its capabilities and market reach, and it marks an exciting new chapter for both VPS and Diamond,” added Dean Warras, Chief Executive Officer of both entities. “We welcome Diamond Animal Health to our team as we diversify our product offerings, expand our research, further the company’s development capabilities, and elevate overall operations.”
