As Private-Equity Agribusiness Deals Slow Down, Granite Creek Picks Up the Pace

Granite Creek Capital Partners bought Ritchie Industries Inc., a maker of automated livestock watering products, continuing a fast-paced effort to beef up its agribusiness portfolio.

Ritchie, which was founded in 1929, had been employee-owned since 2004. The Conrad, Iowa-based company, with 70 employees, is a mainstay of the industry.

“If you are running a cow calf operation or a small dairy, you know that this brand has … resonance,” Jim Clark, a partner at Granite Creek, said in an interview with Crain’s. “They make a high-quality product that is reliable. They always are looking to innovate.”

Chicago-based Granite Creek has been on an acquisition spree in the agribusiness space, making three deals in the past three months despite an overall slowdown in the sector. Sluggish commodity prices and uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration’s impact on the farm economy have cooled the dealmaking environment.

The total value of private-equity agribusiness deals fell to $1.56 billion last year through mid-August, from $3.04 billion in the same period of 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The number of announced deals during that period decreased to 114 from 158.

But Granite Creek is buying companies that are making products farmers or ranches need if they want to stay afloat, which alleviates concerns about overall trends in the marketplace.

“We talk about finding companies to invest in or buy that are ‘needs to have, not wants to have,’” Clark said. “The companies we have invested in are foundational and fundamental. Because they are not discretionary items, that gives us confidence to continue to make these investments, knowing that they have a very highly relevant place in their markets.”

The deal for Ritchie, which stemmed from the company putting itself on the market, took about six months to close, Clark said.

Financial terms were not released. Clark said the investment was similar in size to the cost of other Granite Creek acquisitions. Last month, the firm took a stake in Gurnee-based Seedbox for less than $50 million.

Rural American Fund, a private-equity fund, provided additional money for the deal and Ritchie’s management and employees also put up some funds in a rollover investment.

Granite Creek is keeping Ritchie’s management team in place. The investment will be used to expand the company’s share in its core markets, expand geographic coverage and grow its product portfolio in the horse industry.

Granite Creek has been making agribusiness deals for about a decade. Clark has said the sector is a niche that does not have the kind of attention from private-equity firms that other parts of the economy do.

The private-equity firm, which also plays in the manufacturing, business services and health care space, is focused on companies that are already generating revenue and have annual EBITDA of less than $10 million a year.
