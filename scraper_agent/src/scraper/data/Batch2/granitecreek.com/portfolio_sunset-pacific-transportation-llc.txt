Sunset Pacific Transportation has distinguished itself as one of the few national logistics providers of Volume Less Than Truckload (“Volume LTL”) shipment services, and the leader in Southern California. Volume LTL is ideal for shipments that are too large, too heavy, too bulky, and/or too fragile for Traditional LTL, and too small to fill a whole trailer for Truckload shipping. The Company’s advanced freight consolidation and routing capabilities allow it to offer a unique solution that serves the niche between traditional LTL and Truckload. Its high-touch service delivers a value-priced, faster, direct-to-customer delivery alternative to its customers and results in fewer freight claims compared to traditional shipping methods. Sunset Pacific provides a critical link in its customers’ supply chain and is relied upon by hundreds of third-party logistics companies (“3PLs”) as well as direct shippers.
