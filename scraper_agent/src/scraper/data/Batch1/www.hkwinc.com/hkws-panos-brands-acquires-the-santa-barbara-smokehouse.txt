HKW’s PANOS Brands Acquires The Santa Barbara Smokehouse

INDIANAPOLIS, IN, May 14, 2024 – Today, HKW announced its portfolio company, PANOS Brands, LLC (“PANOS”), a provider of branded consumer foods, has acquired The Santa Barbara Smokehouse business (“SBS”).   SBS is a leader in producing smoked salmon of the highest quality. SBS products are artisanally smoked in a smokehouse burning full logs in an open fire kiln.  In addition to being served in foodservice channels, including many of the world’s finest restaurants and premier hotels, SBS products also are available in traditional retail outlets.  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

“Having built The Santa Barbara Smokehouse with a singular focus on producing the highest quality smoked salmon, I’m excited for PANOS to expand the reach of these products to fuel consumer interest in high quality smoked salmon,” said Tim Brown, Founder and Managing Director of The Santa Barbara Smokehouse.  “SBS products are differentiated in the marketplace.  The portfolio is aligned with consumer trends, including the demand for super-premium quality, and the continued interest in better-for-you foods like smoked salmon that are rich in protein and omega-3,” said Darcy Zbinovec, CEO of PANOS Brands.  “We are excited to partner with PANOS’ customers to expand availability of this distinctive smoked salmon across foodservice and retail channels.”

The acquisition of SBS is PANOS Brands’ second of 2024, following the January 2024 purchase of Tessemae’s Salad Dressings & Condiments.  “Strategically, The Santa Barbara Smokehouse is an outstanding addition to our line-up of brands at PANOS,” said Mike Foisy, HKW’s President. “With a strong foundation of great products, we believe SBS offers a great platform for robust long-term growth.”
