Foundations

HKW is an Indianapolis-based private equity firm investing in middle-market companies across North America; we are built on a 100+ year history focused on integrity. Our core partners have worked together for years, sharing a vision to create value for our investors, companies, and employees.

At HKW, our approach is simple: We believe personal interaction and mutual respect are the foundation for lasting relationships. We do what we say we are going to do, rolling up our sleeves and doing the hard work necessary to get the job done. This philosophy has been at our core throughout the firm’s history, and we intend to keep it that way.

Today

HKW operates utilizing the Four Pillar approach for Sourcing, Transactions, Operations, and Exits.

Our Team

The HKW Four Pillar approach unlocks our creativity, highlights our strengths, and encourages a culture of continuous improvement for every investment process. Senior leaders manage their respective pillars within a typical private equity lifecycle (Sourcing, Transactions, Operations, Exits), working collaboratively to find, close, grow, and exit our portfolio companies. It is always about the team; working together, we are stronger!
