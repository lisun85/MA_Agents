HKW Announces Expansion of Operational Resources

INDIANAPOLIS (July 1, 2022) – At HKW, we believe in providing support and resources to our portfolio companies; this is part of our culture of continuous operational improvement. As part of this, we are thrilled to announce the expansion of HKW’s Operations Pillar to include OPERATING EXECUTIVES*. HKW’s operating executives, are leaders within their area of expertise, and are focused on driving value through strategic and operational initiatives. By leveraging these resources, HKW can react to portfolio company needs while building stronger companies and accelerating value creation.

Mike Foisy, President HKW, stated, “HKW is very excited to have these three individuals as resources to support our portfolio companies. Kevin and Mike have already added value at CTS and Technical Toolboxes. Dave has added support to PANOS and Brant Instore. I am excited to see further successes from these three individuals. HKW is also focused on increasing the pool of HKW Operating Executives so we have a suite of resources our portfolio companies can pull from to improve companies and create value for all stakeholders.”

*HKW’s Operating Executives, while not employees, members, personnel, or affiliates of HKW, are leaders in their respective fields who are available to provide industry guidance to HKW and may make significant contributions to HKW, its portfolio companies, and investors.
