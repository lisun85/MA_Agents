Gemini Announces Two New Platform Investments
September 20 2022

Gemini is pleased to announce two new platform investments.

In May, Gemini completed the recapitalization of Twenty First Century Health Care Consultants (“21st Century”), a leading provider of outsourced consulting services to home health care agencies. Home Care for the 21st Century, an affiliated franchisor of home health care services, was also recapitalized as part of the transaction.  Founded in 1995 and based in Bradenton, Florida, 21st Century provides a full suite of administrative and regulatory consulting services to home care, home health care, and hospice agencies across the United States.  The Company works primarily with new or prospective agencies to guide them through the complex processes and requirements associated with opening and operating a home health agency. The franchise business was founded in 2019 and provides franchisees a path to service customers along the full continuum of home care.  For more information, please visit homehealthcareconsultants.com and homecareforthe21stcenturyfranchise.com.

In August, Gemini completed an investment in The Bear Group, a business-to-business consulting firm providing custom website development services, e-commerce solutions, and ongoing support.  Founded in 2007 and based in Seattle, The Bear Group has expertise across a variety of e-commerce platforms and supports customers through all phases of website implementation – planning, development, launch, and post-launch support.  For more information, please visit www.beargroup.com.
