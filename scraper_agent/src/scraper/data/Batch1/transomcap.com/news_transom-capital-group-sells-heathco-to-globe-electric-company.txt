Transom Capital Group Sells HeathCo to Globe Electric Company
December 2, 2021

LOS ANGELES – December 2, 2021 – Transom Capital Group (“Transom”), an operations-focused middle market private equity firm, today announced it has sold Heath Zenith, LLC (“HeathCo” or the “Company”), a leading provider of outdoor security lighting, decorative lighting, and door chimes based in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Globe Electric Company.

HeathCo is the leading provider of outdoor home security LED lighting, residential notification systems, and motion-activated decorative lighting in the do-it-yourself (“DIY”) repair and remodel space.  HeathCo has an established base of blue-chip retail customers, which enables the Company to reach end users across 10,000+ retail stores through the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  The Company is considered a “category captain” due to the #1 market position in all three product categories in which the Company competes.

Russ Roenick, Managing Partner at Transom, said, “Selling a high-performing business like HeathCo is always a bittersweet moment for a hands-on investor like us.  We spent several years working hand-in-hand with the tremendous employees of this business, and it resulted in a great outcome.  We are very proud of the strong partnership we formed with CEO Kenny Ramsey throughout the journey of expanding HeathCo’s market share and transforming it into a digitally-connected business.” 

“Transom was the perfect business partner to help position HeathCo for success.  We worked tirelessly together to develop and execute strategies to grow and transform our business into an industry leading connected security lighting and door chime platform. HeathCo is positioned well to provide years of growth and expansion for Globe Electric”, said Kenny Ramsey, CEO of HeathCo.

Raymond James served as financial advisors and Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal advisor to Transom and HeathCo in the transaction.
