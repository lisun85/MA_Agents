CLEVELAND, OH – March 11, 2014 – Ninth Street Capital Partners (NSCP) is pleased to announce the closing of an investment in Kitchen Cabinet Distributors (KCD). NSCP partnered with KCD’s founders, Richard and Pauline Gambill as well as F.N.B. Capital Partners to complete the acquisition. Terms were not disclosed.

“KCD has provided quality designs and craftsmanship to the residential cabinetry industry throughout its history.  The Gambill’s attention to customer service while providing finely crafted cabinets at industry leading prices has allowed the Company to grow since its founding. We believe that this partnership will best position KCD to take advantage of the rebounding demand for building products in the U.S.,” said Weiner, Managing Partner at NSCP. “With the anticipated growth, KCD is currently looking to add additional employees.”

 “With an operating model that emphasizes customer service and industry leading prices, KCD is a trusted provider to cabinetmakers, dealers, remodelers, and builders throughout the United States,” added Dickinson, Managing Partner at NSCP.

“KCD has played a critical role in providing service to the residential remodeling and building markets for almost 10 years,” remarked Gambill. “We see a tremendous opportunity to accelerate KCD’s growth while continuing to provide exceptional service and prices to our customers.  With the new ownership group, we hope to build on our leading position by expanding our customer base and our product offerings.”
