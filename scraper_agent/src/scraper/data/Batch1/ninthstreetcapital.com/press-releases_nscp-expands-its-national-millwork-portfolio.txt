1/5/2020 | By: Ninth Street Capital Partners

CLEVELAND, Ohio — January 6, 2020 – USA Millwork, a portfolio company of Ninth Street Capital Partners (NSCP) and the largest turnkey manufacturer of custom architectural millwork in the U.S., has acquired Mission Bell, the leading architectural millwork manufacturer in California. Mission Bell was founded in 1959 and is known for some of the most high-profile work in the country. The acquisition brings the number of USA Millwork locations to five with a combined manufacturing footprint of nearly 400,000 square feet. Additionally, the acquisition adds west coast capacity and enhances service to USA Millwork’s customers throughout the U.S. 

“We are excited to add Mission Bell to the USA Millwork family. For over 60 years, the Scianna family built one of the elite millwork businesses in the country and we are honored to be able to carry on their tradition of excellence,” noted Michael Weiner, Managing Partner at NSCP.  “Mission Bell’s reputation for intricate high-quality products and its ability to meet demanding schedules has won them an outstanding reputation in the industry. The acquisition allows USA Millwork to add capacity, capabilities, and industry-leading practices to better serve customers across its existing national platform.” 

Glenn Ripley, Mission Bell’s CEO, who will be joining USA Millwork as President, added “USA Millwork’s vision for building a best-in-class millwork company with a national footprint dove-tailed with our vision of growing Mission Bell both within and beyond the Bay Area. With the USA Millwork platform, we can leverage Mission Bell’s technology, manufacturing capabilities, installation services and a nationwide supply chain to design and build custom millwork and case goods across a range of sectors. Patrick Dickinson, USA Millwork’s CEO, and Ripley will work hand-in-hand to run USA Millwork. 

McDonald Hopkins provided legal counsel on the transaction and Flagstar Bank and Tecum Capital Partners lead the debt financing.
