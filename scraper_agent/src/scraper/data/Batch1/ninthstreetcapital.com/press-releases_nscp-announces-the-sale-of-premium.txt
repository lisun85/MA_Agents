CLEVELAND, OH – November 24, 2021 – Ninth Street Capital Partners (NSCP) is pleased to announce that it has successfully sold its interests in Premium Inspection and Testing Group (Premium) to Acuren, an industry leader in nondestructive testing (NDT), inspection, engineering, and rope access integrated services.  

Premium was formed in 2015 as a platform to execute on a buy-and-build strategy in the industrial non-destructive testing and inspection industry. Under NSCP’s ownership, Premium acquired Quad City Testing Labs (Davenport, IA), Capitol Ultrasonics (Baton Rouge, LA), Landbros (Baton Rouge, LA), Quality Testing Services (St. Louis, MO) and Infrared Thermal Imaging (Corpus Christi, TX). Premium, which offers NDT, rope access, drone and robotic services, infrared inspection, and calibration services, became a regional leader serving petrochemical, refining, food processing, midstream energy, and chemical customers in the Gulf Coast and Midwest. 

“We are thrilled to be joining Acuren,” said Premium CEO Dal Miller. “Our employees will be afforded enhanced career growth opportunities as part of Acuren, and our customers will enjoy broader service line offerings with a continued focus on doing the work right the first time.” 

Michael Weiner, Managing Partner at NSCP, added, “We were proud to work with Dal and the entire Premium team to build Premium into a regional market leader while creating such a valuable and customer service oriented company.”
