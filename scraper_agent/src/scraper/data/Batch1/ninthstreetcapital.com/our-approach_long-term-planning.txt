Long-Term Planning

Over time, we collaborate with management to develop a long-term plan for the company. Our structured approach to acquisition financing provides management with tremendous flexibility when considering what is best for the business and its shareholders. Ninth Street consistently exits with management’s full support. 

When we enter an investment, we do not define a set exit or holding period for the business. In most cases, we remain invested for a period of three to seven years. However, we have the ability to hold our investments indefinitely.
