A&M Capital Europe Announces Majority Investment in GBUK Group

January 9, 2024 – A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based middle-market private equity investment firm with €650 million of assets under management, announces the acquisition of a majority stake in GBUK Group (the “Company”), a leading global provider of specialist single-use medical devices, from H2 Equity Partners (“H2EP”).

Headquartered in the United Kingdom, GBUK designs, develops and distributes a comprehensive portfolio of own and third-party branded acute-setting medical devices across enteral feeding, vascular access, patient handling and the broader critical care environment. The Company is a top 20 supplier to the UK National Health Service (“NHS”) and supports healthcare professionals and patients in over 45 countries with more than 600,000 medical devices daily. GBUK has demonstrated a track record of penetrating new care areas by leveraging its R&D capabilities and a high-touch sales model hinging on wrap-around services.

The partnership with AMCE is expected to enable GBUK to enhance patient care further and drive the innovation required to support the evolving needs of patients and healthcare providers. Leveraging GBUK’s intimate understanding of patient needs, new product development expertise and global supply-chain capabilities, the Company is well-positioned to continue delivering on this mission and support patients globally.

Additionally, with AMCE’s support, GBUK intends to pursue bolt-on acquisitions, focusing primarily on proprietary medical device specialists in the United Kingdom and broader European and North American markets.

GBUK will continue under the leadership of its existing management team, led by CEO Mike Geering, with Mike and his team investing alongside AMCE. AMCE was advised by Weil, Gotshal & Manges as legal adviser, Houlihan Lokey as financial adviser, MDW Capital Partners as debt adviser, Boston Consulting Group as commercial adviser, Alvarez & Marsal as accounting and operational adviser, and EY as tax adviser.
