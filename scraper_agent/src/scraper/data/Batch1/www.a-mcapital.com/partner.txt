A&M Capital Partners (“AMCP”), with assets under management of $3 billion, is AMC’s flagship investment strategy focused on middle-market control transactions in North America. Since inception of this strategy we have invested in over 100 companies across 21 platforms.

TARGET SITUATIONS

We seek to invest in:

 

Founder or family-owned businesses seeking institutional backing

Companies that require assistance in developing internal resources, capacity and infrastructure for future growth, or can otherwise benefit from access to operational resources or industry relationships

“Platform” acquisitions which will enable us to pursue build-up and consolidation strategies, where we believe we are able to add significant value in leveraging A&M’s merger integration capabilities

Opportunities to back experienced industry executives seeking a partner to pursue an identified investment thesis

Corporate divestitures or carve-outs, which often require significant operational and / or managerial support to create well-functioning and efficient stand-alone businesses

Public to private transactions


Special situations in which a liquidity solution facilitates the recapitalization of a stressed balance sheet and/or bespoke solutions for underperforming credits in bank and other lender portfolios

INVESTMENT APPROACH

We seek to:

 

Target investments in businesses with defensible market positions and strong reputations with existing customers and other stakeholders

Focus on stable to growing end markets, although we will selectively consider investments in “out of favor” industries

Invest in companies where we believe we can add significant value, either by virtue of leveraging operational resources, industry relationships and / or M&A capabilities

Build market leaders with strong operations that will be positioned to succeed over the long term

Utilize a flexible approach, creating transactions that are structured to provide either full or significant upfront liquidity with additional future upside depending on the sellers’ preferences as appropriate
