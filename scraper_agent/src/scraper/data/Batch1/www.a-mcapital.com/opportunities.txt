A&M Capital Opportunities (“AMCO”), with assets under management of $500 million, is AMC’s lower middle market growth strategy, focused on shared control and structured minority equity investments in North America. AMCO partners with business owners and management teams to help recapitalize and grow businesses, leveraging deep operational capabilities and industry relationships to position them for accelerated long-term growth. We have significant experience with all types of transactions, including growth equity, growth buyouts, recapitalizations, and consolidations of fragmented sectors.

TARGET SITUATIONS

We seek to invest in:

 

Founder or family-owned businesses seeking institutional backing


High growth middle-market companies, assisting the existing team in developing the operational scale and professionalization required to support continued growth

Operational initiatives such as in-sourcing of manufacturing, increasing capacity, opening additional retail outlets, or investing in working capital, among others

An acquisition of a product, competitor or supplier

“Platform” acquisitions which will enable us to pursue build-up and consolidation strategies, where we are able to add significant value in leveraging A&M’s merger integration capabilities

Corporate divestitures or carve-outs, which often require significant operational and / or managerial support to create well-functioning and efficient stand-alone businesses

INVESTMENT APPROACH

We seek to:

 

Target companies with strong business franchises and brand identities, maintaining defensible market positions in growing end markets

Focus on businesses with a commitment to loyalty, customer experience, transparency and quality, generating attractive recurring revenue streams leading to stable and predictable cash flows

Invest in companies where we believe we can add significant value, by virtue of leveraging operational resources, industry relationships and / or M&A capabilities

Build consensus throughout the organization and working alongside our partners to drive toward a common goal – understand nuances of being a minority equity partner

Make control investments still driven by partnership philosophy with a shared-control approach

Provide significant partial liquidity to founders who wish to remain invested and involved in the business going forward, as well as full or partial liquidity to non-critical shareholders
