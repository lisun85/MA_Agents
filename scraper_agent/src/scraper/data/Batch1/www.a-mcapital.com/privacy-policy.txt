Why We Use Your Personal Data

We rely on various legal bases under applicable data protection legislation in order to process your personal data, including our legitimate interests, contractual necessity and as required by law.

We do not allow third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes in accordance with our instructions. We do not authorise these third-party service providers to use or disclose the personal data except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator, national security, for the purposes of public importance or any other legal or investigatory process involving us.

Security and Retention of Personal Data

We are committed to protecting the personal data you entrust to us. We adopt robust and appropriate security measures and policies, so the information we have about you is protected to the extent possible from unauthorized access, loss, destruction or improper use. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any information or data transmitted to or through Our Website; any transmission of information or data by you to or through this site is at your sole risk.

We will keep your personal data only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. We will not keep more information than we need for those purposes. We may also retain your personal data so that we can continue to improve your experience with us and to ensure that you receive any information or marketing materials which would benefit you. We will also keep your personal data where we need to do so in connection with regulatory requirements, legal action or an investigation involving AMC and our affiliates. Once our processing of your personal data is no longer necessary, we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. For further information about how long we will keep your personal data, please contact info@am-capital.com.

This EU and UK Privacy Notice supplements the general [Privacy Notice] with respect to individuals located in the EU, the EEA, or the UK, to the extent that EU and UK data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the UK implementation of the GDPR, and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “EU and UK Privacy Laws”) applies to the personal data processing activities set out in the general Privacy Notice. Information that is required to be disclosed to individuals located in the EU, EEA or UK that is not set out in this EU and UK Privacy Notice is otherwise set out in the general Privacy Notice.

For the purposes of applicable EU and UK Privacy Laws, AMC and/or one or more of our affiliates will be a controller of any personal data collected by us. As a "controller" under applicable data protection laws, we are responsible for deciding how we collect and use personal data about you and for the information contained in this EU and UK Privacy Notice.

If you are a natural person in the EU or the UK and the EU and UK Privacy Laws apply to you, and have any questions about the EU and UK Privacy Notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, you may contact us at info@am-capital.com.

Personal Data We Process

Our general Privacy Notice sets out [The Data We Collect about You] . We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data, etc.).

Other Legal Bases

We rely on various legal bases under the EU and UK Privacy Laws in order to process your personal data, as we have set forth in the general Privacy Notice in the section [Why We Use Your Personal Data] . The section also sets out the specific purposes for which we use your personal data, which in general is to operate our business, conduct business with you and perform essential or legitimate business operations.

If we require your personal data due to a legal requirement or obligation or in order to perform a contract with you, we will make you aware of this at the time we collect your personal data, and the possible consequences of failure to provide this personal data (e.g., inability to conduct business with you and cancelling an existing arrangement, receiving an unoptimized user experience when visiting our website, etc.).

Transfers outside the EEA or UK

Your personal data may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA which may not always have data protection laws providing equivalent protection. To the extent your personal data is transferred to countries outside of the EEA, such transfers will only be made in accordance with applicable data privacy laws and we will take steps to ensure that your information is protected by appropriate organisational and security measures, and that any such transfers are done using specific legally-approved safeguards. For further information about the safeguards used and details of any relevant non-EEA countries, please contact info@am-capital.com.

Your Rights

Note that this section of the EU and UK Privacy Policy only applies to the extent that the EU and UK Privacy Laws apply to you. You have the right to access and control (in certain ways) the personal data we process about you. To exercise these rights and controls, please contact info@am-capital.com.

YOUR RIGHT
PURPOSE
 
Access
You have the right to ask for a copy of the personal data that we hold about you free of charge, however we may charge a ‘reasonable fee’, if we think that your request is excessive, to help us cover the costs of locating the information you have requested.
 
Correction
You may notify us of changes to your personal data if it is inaccurate or it needs to be updated.
 
Deletion
If you think that we shouldn’t be holding or processing your personal data any more, you may request that we delete it. Please note that this may not always be possible due to legal obligations.
 
Restrictions on use
If you think that we shouldn’t be holding or processing your personal data any more, you may request that we delete it. Please note that this may not always be possible due to legal obligations.
 
Objection
You have the right to object to processing, including: (i) for direct marketing; (ii) for research or statistical purposes; or (iii) where processing is based on legitimate interests.
 
Portability
If you wish to transfer your personal data to another organisation (and certain conditions are satisfied), you may ask us to do so, and we will send it directly if we have the technical means.
 
Withdrawal of consent
If you previously gave us your consent (by a clear affirmative action) to allow us to process your personal data for a particular purpose, but you no longer wish to consent to us doing so, you can contact us to let us know that you withdraw that consent.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

Complaints

Should you wish to lodge a complaint with regards to how your personal data has been processed by us, please contact your local supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to deal with your concerns before you approach a relevant supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.

In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office – https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us.

In the EU, please contact your local supervisory authority in particular in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the infringement, concern or complaint.

If at any point we decide to collect personal data or use any collected personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify applicable users by posting changes on this page.
