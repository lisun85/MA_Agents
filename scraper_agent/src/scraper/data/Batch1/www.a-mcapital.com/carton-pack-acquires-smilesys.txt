Carton Pack acquires Smilesys

Carton Pack, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based middle-market private equity investment firm with €650 million of assets under management, has completed the acquisition of Smilesys (the “Company”), an Italian producer of resealable and sustainable packaging products from its founders.

Founded in 2013, Smilesys primarily serves the fruit & vegetable end-market and the snacks and bakery segments. The Company is headquartered in Veneto (Northern Italy). Smilesys focuses on resealable solutions that enhance shelf-life, reduce food waste and can be applied to compostable materials, with ~95% of final products sold outside of Italy. The Company will continue to be led by its management team, including CEO Ernesto Zanarella.

The acquisition further enhances Carton Pack’s footprint in sustainable products while expanding into innovative technologies. In addition, it is consistent with Carton Pack’s strategy to become a leading European food packaging specialist with a multi-material product offering. The transaction is Carton Pack’s second add-on acquisition since AMCE acquired a majority stake in Carton Pack in April 2022.

AMCE and Carton Pack were advised by Chiomenti, as legal counsel for M&A and corporate matters, and Gattai, as legal counsel for financing matters, KPMG as accounting and tax advisers and Ramboll as environmental, health & safety adviser.
