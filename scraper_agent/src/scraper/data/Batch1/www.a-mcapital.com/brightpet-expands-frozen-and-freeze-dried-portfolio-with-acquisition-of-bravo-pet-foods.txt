BrightPet Expands Frozen and Freeze-Dried Portfolio with Acquisition of Bravo! Pet Foods

A&M Capital Partners-backed BrightPet extends its reach in growing premium pet food category and adds an innovative and respected brand to its portfolio

Lisbon, Ohio-(BUSINESS WIRE)–BrightPet Nutrition Group (“BrightPet”), a leading marketer and manufacturer of premium and super-premium pet foods, treats and care products, has completed the strategic acquisition of Bravo! Pet Foods (“Bravo”), a pioneer in frozen raw and freeze-dried pet diets. The transaction by BrightPet, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Partners (“AMCP”), a middle-market private equity investment fund, is the second in two years, reflecting the company’s commitment to a M&A strategy that bolsters its branded portfolio while extending capabilities in high growth market segments.

BrightPet serves domestic and more than 30 international markets with branded, private label, and contract manufactured products. BrightPet operates a portfolio of widely recognized leading consumer brands, including Stewart®, Blackwood®, Adirondack®, By Nature®, Miracle Care® and Hamilton®, with holistic and natural solutions.

“The Bravo brand is widely known and has been respected for more than 20 years. We believe Bravo’s commitment to innovation, premium ingredients and the highest standard of manufacturing aligns well with BrightPet,” said Dave Kowal, CEO of BrightPet. “This acquisition supports our vision to be the most valued pet platform in the industry. By expanding our branded portfolio and strengthening our production capabilities, we expect to continue the growth trajectory BrightPet has established over the past few years.”

Founded by the Bogner family in 2002 in Manchester, Conn., Bravo was one of the first brands to manufacture and sell frozen raw and freeze-dried pet food, and is a leader in educating the industry and pet parents as to the health benefits of a raw diet. In addition to a range of treats, chews and supplements for dogs and cats, Bravo offers five meal solutions, including complete and balanced meals as well as customizable nutrition plans. Bravo products include:

Bravo! Homestyle Complete: freeze-dried raw meals maximizing nutrition, flavor and texture,
Bravo! Balance: frozen chubs and burgers, complete and balanced dinners containing essential nutrients,
Bravo! Blends: a four-part, limited ingredient formula,
Bravo! Basics: a medley of meat, bone and organ meat, and
Bravo! Boneless: nothing but real meat or fish.

Melinda Miller, former CEO of Bravo, will join BrightPet as the Vice President of Bravo Brands. Melinda is a leading expert in nutrition, formulation and innovation, and she will help lead the integration of capabilities through the BrightPet portfolio.

“We could not be more excited for Bravo to join the BrightPet family of brands,” said Miller. “We believe BrightPet and AMCP immediately provide complementary resources, enabling the creation of new products for years to come. BrightPet’s commitment to innovation, quality, reliability, and safety provide an unmatched foundation to grow together.”

“When we acquired BrightPet, our goal was to grow the Company into a premier platform in pet food, treats, and care products, with a differentiated portfolio of meaningful brands and best-in-industry production capabilities,” said Ryan McCarthy, Partner at AMCP. “In the two years since our acquisition, BrightPet has achieved significant domestic and international growth in super-premium product categories and increased share in high-growth channels, including e-commerce. We have completed two strategic acquisitions and have more than doubled the Company’s revenues, the number of brands in our portfolio, and, most importantly, invested heavily in manufacturing capabilities to consistently deliver new and innovative product offerings. We believe our domestic production capabilities, growing portfolio of brands, and industry-leading innovation are compelling differentiators for those looking for a manufacturing partner or to become part of a larger platform. We look forward to continuing to add complementary and accretive businesses to the BrightPet family.”

Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP provided legal counsel to AMCP and BrightPet.
