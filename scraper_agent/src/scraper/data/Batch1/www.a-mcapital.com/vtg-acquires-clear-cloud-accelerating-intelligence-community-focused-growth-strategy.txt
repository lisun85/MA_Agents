VTG Acquires Clear Cloud, Accelerating Intelligence Community-Focused Growth Strategy

CHANTILLY, Va., June 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — VTG, an industry-leading national security solutions provider, announced that it has acquired Clear Cloud, LLC, strengthening its digital transformation capabilities and accelerating its Intelligence Community-focused growth strategy. Based in Northern Virginia, Clear Cloud delivers software, cloud, and data engineering solutions and services to U.S. Intelligence Community customers and missions.

“We are excited to welcome Clear Cloud and its remarkably talented cadre of developers, engineers, and technologists to VTG,” said John Hassoun, VTG President and CEO. “The acquisition of Clear Cloud enables VTG to address emerging challenges to national security and highlights our commitment to investing in the software-oriented capabilities and expertise our Intelligence Community customers need most.”

Clear Cloud was founded in 2018 to provide innovative, secure, and scalable cloud solutions for enterprise-level and mission-critical national security programs. The Company’s customer-centric approach and differentiated expertise in custom Intelligence Community cloud environments have earned Clear Cloud a high-performance reputation for developing and deploying specialized applications, optimizing cloud operations, and ensuring mission success. Clear Cloud co-founder and CEO, Dr. Charles Thomas, Jr. said, “I am extremely excited for the Clear Cloud team. This milestone is a testament to their dedication and exceptional talent, and a direct reflection of the outstanding contributions of each team member. VTG shares our commitment to the pursuit of excellence and our passion for creativity and innovation. We are thrilled to enter the next phase of our journey with such a great partner.”

The acquisition of Clear Cloud underscores and accelerates VTG’s software-oriented Intelligence Community growth strategy. It is VTG’s second acquisition since receiving a majority investment from private equity firm A&M Capital Partners in September 2023 and follows close on the heels of VTG’s April 2024 acquisition of digital transformation innovator Vana Solutions.
