GBUK Acquires Care & Independence

1 July 2024 – GBUK, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired Care & Independence (“C&I”), a fast-growing UK provider of patient handling and moving devices.

Founded in 1985, C&I specialises in providing medical slings, bathing equipment and broader postural support devices. Within its core UK market, C&I is a preferred supplier to the National Health Service (“NHS”) and primarily serves the needs of patients within the community setting via loan store operators, independent local authorities, and NHS Trusts. Like GBUK, C&I operates a clinician-orientated high-touch sales model that supports Occupational Therapists with clinical product training and patient requirement assessments.

The acquisition of C&I represents GBUK’s first acquisition since AMCE’s investment in December 2023. The acquisition is expected to strengthen GBUK’s positioning within the UK patient handling market, providing further breadth to GBUK’s product offering and an established platform for growth within the community setting.

GBUK were advised by Burness Paull as legal adviser, Accuracy as accounting adviser, and EY as tax adviser.
