Carton Pack Acquires Clifton Packaging Group

November 2024 – Carton Pack, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired UK-based Clifton Packaging Group Limited (“Clifton” or the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative primary flexible food packaging solutions.

Founded in 1981 and headquartered in Leicester, UK, Clifton serves a broad range of blue-chip clients, with a particular focus on the protein and snacks markets. We believe Clifton’s speciality in recyclable films with anti-fog and anti-bacterial properties and its expertise in resealable pouches positions it as a critical player in wet protein packaging. Clifton will continue to operate under the leadership of its management team, led by CEO Shane D’Souza.

We believe this acquisition represents a significant milestone in Carton Pack’s strategy to become a leading European food packaging specialist, strengthening its footprint in flexible packaging, expanding into the attractive snacks and protein end-markets and establishing a robust presence in the UK market. The transaction is Carton Pack’s third add-on acquisition since AMCE acquired a majority stake in April 2022.

Carton Pack was advised by Chiomenti, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Charles Russell Speechlys as legal counsels for M&A and corporate matters, Weil Gotshal & Manges and Pedersoli Gattai for financing matters, PWC and EY as accounting and tax advisers, Food Strategy Associates as commercial adviser, Howden as insurance adviser and Ramboll as environmental adviser.
