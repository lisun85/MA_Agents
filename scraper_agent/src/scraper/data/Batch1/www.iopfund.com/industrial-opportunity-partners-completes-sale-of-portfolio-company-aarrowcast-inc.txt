Evanston, Ill., November 30, 2021 – Industrial Opportunity Partners (“IOP”), an operations-focused private equity firm based in Evanston, Ill., today announced that it has completed the sale of portfolio company Aarrowcast, Inc. (“Aarrowcast” or the “Company”) to Charter Manufacturing Company, Inc. (“Charter”), a family-owned steel and iron manufacturing company.
