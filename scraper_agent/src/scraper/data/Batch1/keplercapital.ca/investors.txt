Kepler Capital acquires small- and mid-sized businesses across North America, and provides investors an opportunity to own a basket of exceptional companies.

 

OUR PHILOSOPHY

We believe that small- and mid-sized businesses are an under-appreciated investment, offering the potential for exceptional, diversified returns. We are long-term investors, and accordingly, we believe in long-term capital appreciation, with strong governance, clear vision, and a modest risk profile.

“
When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.
— Warren Buffet, Letter to Shareholders 1998
