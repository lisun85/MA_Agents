HAWKEYEPEDERSHAAB AND NEW HAMPTON METAL FAB COMBINE TO PROVIDE GREATER SOLUTIONS TO THE CONCRETE MARKET

MEDIAPOLIS, Iowa — September 6, 2017 — HawkeyePedershaab Concrete Technologies, Inc. expands its presence in the pre-cast concrete equipment market with the announcement today that it has acquired New Hampton Metal Fabrication Corp.  New Hampton Metal Fab marks the first acquisition for HawkeyePedershaab since partnering with BW Forsyth Partners last September.

A market leader in the pipe and precast concrete industry, New Hampton Metal Fab designs and manufactures molds for manholes, boxes, pipes and a variety of other specialty forms and equipment.  New Hampton Metal Fab is headquartered in New Hampton, Iowa and is led by Jamie and Nick Wegner who will both remain with the combined company and lead its wet-cast division that will retain the New Hampton Metal Fab name.  “We are thrilled to be joining forces with HawkeyePedershaab and to work with such a respected company,” stated Jamie Wegner, President of New Hampton Metal Fab. “Combining our two companies will draw on decades of experience to push the boundaries of innovation and remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service to the industries we serve. Since our beginning, our family has always believed in helping the people who work for our company as well as serving our customers’ needs. We look forward to working alongside the HawkeyePedershaab team and the future that we create together.”

“The addition of New Hampton Metal Fab broadens our reach and offerings to our customers by combining the technology and service leaders in dry-cast and wet-cast machinery and form equipment,” stated Brad Schmidgall, President of HawkeyePedershaab.  “We are honored to welcome the New Hampton Metal Fab products and team to HawkeyePedershaab and know our future is bright together.”

BW Forsyth Partners acquired HawkeyePedershaab last September with the goal of building the market leading supplier of equipment and solutions to the pre-cast concrete industry through organic growth and acquisitions.  Ryan Gable, HawkeyePedershaab CEO and BW Forsyth Partners Co-Founder stated, “New Hampton Metal Fab is the ideal first acquisition for HawkeyePedershaab as it adds a great team that we know well, complementary products that we can offer our customers and adds another stable and growing product line that will provide further security and opportunities for our team members.”
