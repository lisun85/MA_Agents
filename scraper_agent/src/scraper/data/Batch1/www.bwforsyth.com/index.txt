OUR APPROACH
We see value where others don't

A business is far more than its financial statements. It is people with families and futures and, so often, untapped potential. As the investment arm of multi-billion dollar global manufacturing and engineering consulting firm Barry-Wehmiller, BW Forsyth Partners blends Barry-Wehmiller’s unparalleled legacy of value creation and people-centric culture development with keen private equity investing experience to help companies realize their true potential.

Since 2009 we have completed 40 acquisitions and currently operate four companies in the capital and component equipment and insurance services sectors. In each business, we deployed operational improvements and strategy development without compromising the autonomy, strategic vision and entrepreneurial spirit of their leadership teams. With every company we acquire, our goal is to buy, build and keep on building, alongside the talented people who make the business possible. Because companies don’t create value; people do.

BW Forsyth Partners is showing that a more humanistic and holistic approach can generate returns equal to or even greater than those produced by traditional private equity, without using excessive leverage, market timing, mass layoffs, and other typical financial buyer tactics. It is an approach of building value, not extracting it.


Bob Chapman, Barry-Wehmiller Chairman and CEO
OUR PARENT COMPANY
Creating value is in our DNA

For more than 30 years, Barry-Wehmiller has tested, refined and improved its successful value creation and culture transformation process on every one of more than 115 businesses they’ve acquired. During that time frame, the company grew from a $20 million business into the diverse $3+ billion global leader it is today. Along the way they figured out the keys to long-term value creation: meaningful work, caring cultures, and the chance to collaborate to achieve something great.
