RYAN THOMAS
VP Supply Chain

Ryan joined the team in early 2020 as Global Sourcing Lead to collaborate with our operating companies on strategies related to supplier relationship management, effective supply chain investment and acquisition integrations.  He closely partners with Barry-Wehmiller supply chain leaders on global supplier management and process improvement initiatives.   

Prior to working at Forsyth, Ryan spent 10 years at Energizer Holdings where he successfully led Personal Care, Household and Auto Care product acquisitions into Energizer’s global supply chain.   In addition, he led Energizer’s Supply Chain in Canada, Central and South America, with functional responsibility for Procurement, Planning, Customer Collaboration and Distribution in those regions.   

Outside of the office, Ryan enjoys reading, traveling, and watching the Buckeyes, Ryan can be found with his wife, Danielle, and their sons enjoying one of St. Louis’s great parks or restaurants.
