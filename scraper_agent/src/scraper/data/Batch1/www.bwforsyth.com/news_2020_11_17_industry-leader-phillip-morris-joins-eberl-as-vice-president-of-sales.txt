INDUSTRY LEADER PHILLIP MORRIS JOINS EBERL AS VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES
Insurance solutions provider welcomes highly accomplished leader with proven track record of driving performance and maximizing growth

LAKEWOOD, Colo. — Nov. 17, 2020 — Eberl Claims Service—part of the Cor Partners family and the nation’s leading technology-empowered insurance solutions provider—is pleased to announce Phillip Morris has joined the organization as Vice President of Sales, a newly developed role for Eberl and U.S. Adjusting Services, which joined together in July 2020.

Morris is an enthusiastic, people-focused leader with more than 14 years of sales, marketing, claims-handling and insurance-industry experience. He has driven omnichannel sales for several of the nation’s best insurance carriers and claim service partners. Before joining the Eberl team, he served as the Head of Growth and Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at another leading insurance adjusting firm. In these roles, he was responsible for the company’s national growth, brand trajectory, client development and cultural transformation, including the creation and execution of innovative initiatives in relationship management, product development and executive leadership. Prior to that, Morris worked at the Hanover Insurance Group and Allstate Insurance.

“We could not be more thrilled about having Phillip join our team,” said Jessica Hamilton, Senior Vice President of Business Development at Eberl. “Phillip is tech-savvy, highly engaged and relationship-driven, and he brings so much passion to our team. In a nutshell, he is a powerhouse with the empathy of a great friend and the competitiveness of a star athlete.”

“I am humbled and honored to join Eberl as the VP of Sales,” said Morris. “I was highly impressed by the leadership across all divisions of the Eberl and Cor Partners teams. It is impressive to see an organization that moves so fluidly in this modern business ecosystem, and it’s extremely encouraging to know that I work for a company focused on creating a vibrant environment and building a culture of compassion and care. I believe that Eberl has tremendous opportunities to capitalize on this foundation, innovate for the future and further grow its ecosystem through people. I look forward to building a team that values the industry, enhances relationships through experience and provides more capabilities that will help our partners expand sustainability. I will focus on continuing to evolve the company’s strategy, while delivering on Eberl’s commitments to invest in relationships, inspire trust and provide exceptional service to all.”
