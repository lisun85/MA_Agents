BW FORSYTH PARTNERS’ COR PARTNERS ACQUIRES DBI CONSTRUCTION CONSULTANTS
Addition will become fourth division of Cor with a focus on building and construction consulting

ST. LOUIS — March 24, 2023 — BW Forsyth Partners’ Cor Partners—the parent company of Eberl Claims Service, Engle Martin and Envista Forensics, which collectively serve the insurance, risk management and legal communities—has acquired DBI Construction Consultants, a leading national provider of building and construction consulting services based in New York. 

Founded in 2002, DBI is a premier brand built by a team of construction experts, with 10 U.S. offices and a global reach. The company provides in-house independent loss and damage measurement services, as well as specialized practices for insurance and legal industry clients. Throughout the past 20 years, DBI has developed a best-in-class reputation for delivering conclusive, evidence-based expertise that brings clarity to complex problems at the intersection of insurance and construction. 

DBI will form a new fourth division inside Cor’s family of companies, which will focus exclusively on building and construction consulting. With this addition, the existing team of building consulting experts and leaders within the U.S. operations of Envista will transition to DBI in the coming months. This newly combined team of more than 125 industry-recognized experts will provide greater reach, expertise and support for clients, significantly enhancing the combined group’s capabilities, coverage and strategic position.

 “We are thrilled to bring another world-class firm into the Cor family,” said John Quinn, Chief Executive Officer of Cor. “DBI’s strong reputation as a premier brand and its long track record of success in the space align well with our commitment to expanding our customer-focused insurance services. By bringing our existing building consulting team together with DBI, we will position both enterprises to provide customers with the best possible expert-driven service.” 

When asked about the acquisition, Dennis Di Millo, Partner and Managing Principal of DBI, said: “Partnering with Cor creates immediate opportunities to better serve our growing list of clients by leveraging resources that will allow us to enter new markets, as well as grow our team and menu of services. Finding a partner that shares our vision, culture, respect for team members and reverence for clients is what makes this alliance exceptional. Knowing that the DBI brand will move forward executing our far-reaching goals adds extra excitement for us.” 

“As Cor continues its impressive trajectory of growth and success, I am incredibly excited about its vision for the future, and am pleased to welcome DBI and its team members into the family,” said Ryan Gable, Managing Partner at BW Forsyth Partners.
