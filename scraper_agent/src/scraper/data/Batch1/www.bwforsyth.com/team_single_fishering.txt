JENNIFER FISHERING
Vice President, Partner Engagement

Jennifer joined the Forsyth team in 2023 as the Director of Internal Operations & Communications. With Forsyth's growth, Jennifer stepped into the role of Vice President of Partner Engagement in 2024 to focus on communications and shareholder experience.

Prior to Forsyth, Jennifer worked at Deli Star Corporation where she served in several roles, including Chief of Staff to the CEO and, most recently, Vice President of Strategic Communications and Partnerships. She was involved in the company’s post-fire rebuild and relocation to St. Louis, managing government affairs, public relations, partner communication, and community stewardship.


Throughout her career, Jennifer has been a thought partner and strategist to leaders in the non-profit and corporate sectors, focusing on people-centric corporate communication, program management, and policy & initiative implementation.

Outside of the office, Jennifer and her husband are proud parents to two children. When they are not cheering on their kids’ hobbies and passions, they are avid concertgoers. Like many St. Louisans, Jennifer loves to be at Busch Stadium during baseball season, but for March Madness her heart is on the East Coast with the Syracuse Orange. Jennifer serves on the Board of Directors of Springboard to Learning.
