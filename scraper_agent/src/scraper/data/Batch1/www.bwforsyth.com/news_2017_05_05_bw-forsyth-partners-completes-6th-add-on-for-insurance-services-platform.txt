ATLANTA — May 4, 2017 — Grover Davis, CEO of Envista Forensics (“Envista”), announced today the acquisition of AREPA, a leading provider of industrial and high-technology equipment restoration based in Silkeborg, Denmark. With this announcement, Envista, known globally as a top provider of forensic engineering and recovery solutions to insurance companies, loss adjusters, in addition to legal and risk management professionals, strengthens their strategic position - already established through Envista’s equipment restoration division, TekPro Global - as the global provider for technical restoration. This acquisition also enables Envista to achieve continued growth for their forensic consulting practice throughout the European insurance market. Envista operates as a division within the insurance services platform of BW Forsyth Partners.

Founded in 1981, today AREPA has over one hundred twenty employees located in ten offices across Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden They are a global provider of comprehensive industrial equipment restoration services to insurers, loss adjusters as well as the marine, offshore and wind energy, and manufacturing industries.

AREPA’s leadership will serve in a pivotal role in leading the resulting global organization.

“AREPA is an innovative leader in the equipment restoration industry, providing consultative and comprehensive recovery solutions for their global clients, and we are honored to have their wonderful team joining the Envista Forensics family,” said Grover Davis, CEO. He went on to add, “In addition to providing an exceptional, world-class work product, the AREPA team shares in Envista’s commitment to providing world-class customer service no matter where in the world it may be needed.” Bob Wedoff, President, remarked, “We’ve always been proud of our TekPro division’s technical abilities, quality and customer service, as well as their international reach from their bases in the US and Canada. Our partnership with AREPA, however, elevates our restoration operations from being an international organization to one that is truly global, and the marriage of AREPA’s specialized competencies in areas such as Marine and Energy complement TekPro’s strengths in a way that brings certainty to the most challenging losses and disasters in a unique and powerful way.”

“On behalf of AREPA, I am truly excited about becoming part of the Envista family. Since AREPA was founded in 1981, it has always been important to strive for service excellence”, commented Torben Vad, Chief Technical Officer at AREPA.

One of my greatest responsibilities is to provide our employees with both security and an opportunity to grow, and Envista represents all the important values that ensure that stability.  In addition, as the market leader in the field of forensic consulting and engineering, Envista provides a variety of   exciting, new opportunities to AREPA’s employees and together, we are a global provider taking our joined services to an even higher level.”
