MACHINE SOLUTIONS INC. ACQUIRES SWITZERLAND-BASED BW-TEC AG
Partnership expands global manufacturing and service footprint, bringing together complementary balloon-manufacturing equipment providers for the medical device industry

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. – Dec. 14, 2020 – Machine Solutions Inc. has announced that it has acquired all of the outstanding stock of BW-TEC AG. The acquisition brings together two industry-leading providers for the medical device industry. BW-TEC, headquartered in Höri, Switzerland, designs and manufactures a range of equipment, including balloon-forming, laser-welding, necking, testing and coating machines, and related accessories.

The acquisition of BW-TEC continues the expansion of technologies offered by Machine Solutions and its industry-leading brands, including MSI, Steeger USA, Vante, PlasticWeld Systems, Crescent Design, Beahm Designs and SEBRA. The BW-TEC team will continue to grow and develop best-in-class equipment in Switzerland, with additional sales and service support from the Machine Solutions global team. In direct alignment with the company’s long-term strategy, this acquisition provides Machine Solutions’ customers with a single source for diverse equipment and services to meet development, production and testing validation needs.

“Machine Solutions is extremely excited to welcome BW-TEC into the family,” said Machine Solutions President Brian Strini. “This is a huge win for our customers who will now have access to BW-TEC resources in the Americas and expanded capabilities for Machine Solutions products in Europe. The combination of our product catalogs, capabilities and locations offers our customers a complete line of catheter manufacturing equipment and services in their geographic locations.”

“Both companies place a high value on customer service and on continuous equipment improvement,” said BW-TEC Managing Director Josia Pantli. “Through the newly formed partnership, we can extend our service throughout the world. We are now able to offer a product line from one source, which has always been requested by our customers. It is a perfect match, and we are excited for our customers.”

BW-TEC is Machine Solutions’ seventh acquisition since joining the BW Forsyth Partners family of companies in 2012 and its third in 2020.
