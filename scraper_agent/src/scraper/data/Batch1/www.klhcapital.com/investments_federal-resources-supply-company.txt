Business Description

Federal Resources is an industry leader in providing innovative and technologically advanced military, first responder, and maritime products. For decades, Federal Resources has been protecting our nation’s elite with these superior products, outstanding customer service, competitive pricing, and expert product knowledge.

Transaction Overview

Management of this family owned business partnered with KLH Capital in a recapitalization to facilitate an ownership transition that allowed the remaining management team to retain a significant equity position within the company, and provided a liquidity event for the retiring shareholders.

Post Transaction

KLH partnered with management to develop the business organically and through acquisition. Immediately post-transaction, KLH assisted with implementing new ERP and CRM systems in the business, helped recruit and develop additional sales professionals, and acquired HazMat IQ, a leading provider of specialty hazardous material training to federal, state, and local first responders.
