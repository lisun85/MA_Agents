CLEVELAND / November 9, 2022 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company, Stax LLC, are pleased to announce the acquisition of London-based AMR International, a global strategy consulting firm specializing in buy and sell-side commercial due diligence across the technology, information, media and events industries.

Expanding in the UK and Europe has been a key part of Stax’s growth plan, and this partnership will lay the groundwork for continued momentum — deepening relationships with private equity firms that are increasingly active in the region.

“The AMR team is thrilled to be joining Stax as we embark on a new period of innovative growth,” said AMR Executive Chairman and Founder Denzil Rankine. “The alignment between our service offerings and cultures, combined with the complimentary geographic coverage our organizations offer, will allow us to provide an even stronger client experience as a united firm, notably for cross-Atlantic private equity firms.”

AMR’s UK position and services offerings made it the ideal inaugural acquisition for the Stax platform.

“Our people are the foundation of our success, and we could not be happier to now count the talented individuals at AMR as part of the Stax team,” said Stax President Jayson Traxler. “Our common vision, emphasis on recruiting and retention, and complementary relationships around the globe pave the way for this partnership’s success.”

“We are excited to see this extremely compatible partnership come to fruition,” said Blue Point Partner Jeff Robich. “Geographic expansion through M&A is a key growth driver and an important component of our long-term strategy for Stax, and AMR’s reputation and presence in the UK is a true enhancement to the platform. We look forward to continuing to support this top-notch management team as they solve challenges and generate innovative ideas on behalf of clients worldwide.”
