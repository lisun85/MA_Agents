CLEVELAND, OH (January 29, 2018) – Blue Point Capital Partners was honored as one of Northeast Ohio's top corporate deal makers at the 22nd Annual ACG Cleveland Deal Maker Awards held on January 25, 2018.  

ACG Cleveland, an organization of M&A and corporate growth professionals, annually recognizes the region's leading corporate deal makers with demonstrated success in fueling sustainable growth through acquisitions, divestitures, financings and other transactions.  

"As a firm deeply rooted in Northeast Ohio, we are honored and humbled to be recognized by our peers, and privileged to join our former portfolio companies who were also on this prestigious stage in recent years.  This is a testament to the strength of the management teams with whom we have partnered," said Sean Ward, a Partner with Blue Point.  “We are particularly proud that so many of our best investments have been made here in Northeast Ohio.”  

This is the fourth time Blue Point has received the ACG Cleveland Deal Maker Award, having also been recognized in 2006, 2013 and 2015.  This achievement also marks the fourth year in a row that Blue Point or one of its portfolio companies was a recipient of an ACG Cleveland Deal Maker Award; two former Blue Point II portfolio companies were recognized as the Private Deal of the Year in recent years – Area Wide Protective in 2016 and Trademark Global in 2017.

Blue Point Capital Partners is a private equity firm managing over $1.5 billion in committed capital.  With offices in Cleveland, Charlotte, Seattle and Shanghai, Blue Point’s geographical footprint allows it to establish relationships with local and regional entrepreneurs and advisors, while providing the resources of a larger, global organization.  The Blue Point partner group has a 19-year track record of partnering with companies in the lower middle-market to facilitate growth and transformative change.  It is one of only a few middle market private equity firms with a presence in both the United States and China, which provides a distinct advantage for its portfolio companies.  Blue Point typically invests in businesses that generate between $20 million and $200 million in revenue.
