Blue Point Capital Partners is proud to announce that the firm has been named on Inc.’s List of Founder Friendly Investors for the fourth time. The award honors “private equity, venture capital and debt firms with the best track records of success backing entrepreneurs,” — according to Inc. Magazine.

“Now more than ever, founder-led companies need financing partners that offer guidance, expertise and understanding — not just capital. These are the private equity, venture capital and debt firms that have founders’ backs when it comes to accelerating growth,” said Inc. Media Editor-in-Chief Scott Omelianuk.

For Blue Point, partnering with entrepreneurs is in our DNA. It is truly an honor to be recognized by Inc. again, and we thank the founders and entrepreneurs who have chosen to trust us as a partner.
