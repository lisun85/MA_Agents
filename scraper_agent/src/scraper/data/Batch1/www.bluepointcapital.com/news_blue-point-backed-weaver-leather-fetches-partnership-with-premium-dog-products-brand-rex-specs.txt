CLEVELAND / June 29, 2023 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company, Weaver Leather, are pleased to announce the acquisition of Rex Specs, a premium brand of outdoor products for active and working canines. This investment marks Weaver’s second add-on acquisition since partnering with Blue Point in March 2021.

Rex Specs began in 2015 when co-founders Aiden and Jesse Emilo sought protective eyewear for their active dogs — only to find a lack of high-performing canine goggles in the market. Built on the principle that “life is better together,” the Jackson, Wyo. company has since committed to providing quality, innovative products that improve the lives and adventures of canines worldwide, including goggles, ear protection and accessories.

“Jesse and I have built Rex Specs on the core value of providing our customers and their canine companions the highest quality products possible,” said Aiden Emilo. “Not only does the Weaver team have significant experience in our industry, but they also share our passion for excellence, making them the preferred partner for continuing to scale our brand.”

Founded in Mt. Hope, Ohio, Weaver is a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of premier brands in the equine, pet, leather crafting, arborist, livestock and construction markets. For 50 years, Weaver has offered high-performance products with a focus on excellence, ease of use and exceptional customer service.

“Rex Specs has established itself as a category leader in the outdoor canine products niche, earning the company a loyal customer base that we are eager and well-equipped to serve and help grow,” said Weaver CEO Jason Weaver. “We are proud to welcome them to the Weaver family of companies.”

With support from Blue Point’s team and elevated supply chain, e-commerce and marketing resources, Weaver will partner with Rex Specs to expand the Company’s customer base and distribution network as well as introduce new products under the Rex Specs brand.

“The Blue Point team is thrilled to support the growth of Rex Specs as it joins the Weaver portfolio of brands,” said Blue Point Partner Charley Geiger. “Both companies share a passion for high-quality, premium product offerings and are in a strong position to drive strategic expansion and growth in the years ahead.”
