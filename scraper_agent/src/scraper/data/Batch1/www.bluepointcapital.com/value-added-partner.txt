Blue Point focuses on opportunities through which we can leverage our collective experience and extensive value creation capabilities. The unique and effective operating resources we bring to our partnerships include:

Unique Global Supply Chain Capabilities
Creating Value through Cross-Border Strategies

In 2004, Blue Point identified the opportunity to create value for U.S. middle market companies by enabling execution of global supply chain-related strategies and established dedicated, in-house resources with unique operational expertise in this area. Today, we remain one of only a handful of U.S. lower middle-market private equity firms with global supply chain expertise. These operations are a core element of our value creation capabilities — our global supply chain professionals work with our portfolio company management teams to globalize revenue streams and drive margin enhancement initiatives.

For decades, large, multinational companies have been able to capture opportunities in the global supply chain with a focus on management of financial resources. We believe that leaders of mid-sized businesses can capture the same opportunities - and we can help identify them. Blue Point provides mid-sized businesses with the capital and expertise needed to execute successful cross-border strategies and accelerate growth of their businesses.

Blue Point Data & Digital
Blue Point Data & Digital – Leveraging Data and Technology, Not Simply Debt

The breadth and complexity of Data & Digital solutions (D&D) available to middle-market businesses can be overwhelming for management teams. Companies seeking to transform or digitally modernize their operations often fear that the energy, expertise and dollar investment needed for execution would be too much of a distraction from core business activities. A private equity partner with strong D&D capabilities can allay all of these concerns and lead the business in building and growing technology-driven operations.

Blue Point’s D&D capabilities are customized to support both digitally native companies and those still in the early stages of their digital journey. We are driven by one goal — partnering with management to add value to our portfolio companies.

Human Capital
Human Capital as a Core Value Creation Lever

Blue Point has a strong track record of investing in human capital at its portfolio companies. In partnership with management, we broaden and deepen their teams while also improving the internal processes that support human capital. This is supported by the over 100 new hires across our current portfolio management teams – an average of 50% of each team is new. In addition to senior team development, we also focus on enhancing employee engagement and company culture by developing and communicating the shared alignment on the key priorities and strengths of the organization. We believe taking care of people helps ensure the success and longevity of the overall businesses.

Our human capital effort also focuses on identifying outstanding operating executives and board members, as well as supporting our companies' diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

M&A Execution
Building Industry Leaders

M&A strategy and execution are core capabilities at Blue Point. Together with portfolio company management teams, we aim to build industry leading businesses by executing both highly strategic transformational acquisitions as well as smaller deals that drive value creation and consolidation in fragmented markets. Geographic growth, customer diversification, product line expansion and management team additions are just some of the ways that add-on acquisitions have benefited our portfolio companies.

The value we bring is in our experience. We often take the lead on add-on target identification, due diligence, capital arrangement, documentation and deal execution. This allows our management teams to fully participate in all the business dynamics of the deal yet remain focused on running the company and minimizing core business disruption.

Operating Executive Group
Seasoned Insights and Support

Blue Point’s Operating Executive Group (OEG) works closely with our portfolio businesses, acting as mentors to management teams by providing counsel and operational support through various business cycles and macro challenges. The members of our OEG average nearly 30 years of operating, management and functional experience across broad range of companies and industries.

Members of Blue Point’s OEG are involved with each company in various capacities from initial screening through exit — consulting with management teams to add value through growth initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions. Our operating executives aren’t just big company folks — they are people with great skillsets as well as the experience and understanding to drive growth in the lower middle-market.
