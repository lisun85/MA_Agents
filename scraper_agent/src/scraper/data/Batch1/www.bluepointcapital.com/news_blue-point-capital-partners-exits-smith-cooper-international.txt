CHARLOTTE, NC (November 28, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners announced today that it has sold its interest in Smith-Cooper International (“Smith-Cooper”) to Tailwind Capital.  Smith-Cooper was a portfolio company in Blue Point II, which is the Firm’s 2006 vintage lower middle-market buyout fund with commitments of $400 million.  Sale terms were not disclosed.  

Smith-Cooper is a value-added designer, producer and distributor of branded valves, fittings and pipe under the SCI®, Sharpe® and FPPI® brands.  The Company provides over 15,000 MRO SKUs to more than 2,000 customers across diverse end markets.  Blue Point recapitalized Smith-Cooper in October 2012.  While under Blue Point’s ownership, Smith-Cooper acquired and integrated its first add-on acquisition with Fire Protection Products, Inc.    

“Smith-Cooper provided a great opportunity for Blue Point to support management with a number of operating improvements, including Asian supply chain management, pricing optimization and analytical tools to enable data driven decision making,” said Juli Marley, a Partner with Blue Point.  “The leadership team focused on several key initiatives which improved profitability and operational efficiency, allowing us to continue to invest in the business and the team to build a true platform ready to support additional growth.  We are extremely proud of the team and the value that they have created.  We wish them well as they embark on the next stage of Smith-Cooper’s growth plan.”  

“Blue Point took a thoughtful approach to our partnership, providing resources and strategic support to enable us to execute our growth strategy,” said Jason Hild, CEO of Smith-Cooper.  “We sincerely appreciated Blue Point’s collaboration and multiple dimensional support for our investments in the management team, operational infrastructure and both organic and acquisition-based growth initiatives.  Having further strengthened the Company’s foundation, we are excited to continue executing our growth strategy in partnership with Tailwind.”
