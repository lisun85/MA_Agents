Blue Point Data & Digital
Bridging the Data & Digital Gap

Middle-market businesses are often ripe for improvement through investment in Data & Digital (D&D) capabilities. However, these investments can be complex and costly. While company founders and management teams understand the opportunities that D&D modernization provides, the lack of resources — financial, operational or both — can prevent them from undertaking strategic projects.

A private equity partner with strong D&D capabilities can help build and grow technology-driven business environments.

Unlocking Value for Middle-Market Businesses Through Data & Digital Strategies

Manage and Modernize a Company

Our robust D&D capabilities are built to support both digitally native middle-market companies and those still in the early stages of incorporating technology to manage and modernize their businesses. Depending on a company’s current level of digital sophistication, our team will partner with management to tailor a strategy for improvement. Opportunities to modernize are applicable across many dimensions — varying business models, channel dynamics, functional areas and product types. No matter the focus, we are driven by one goal — adding value to our portfolio companies.

“In just the first two years of our partnership, Blue Point’s Data & Digital capabilities have helped transform and improve nearly all aspects of how we operate.”

– Robert Williams, President, Kendall Vegetation Services

Our strategic D&D approach is tailored for each company’s situation through qualitative and quantitative assessment. We want to hear what founders and operators believe are their greatest strengths and weaknesses. Starting at a fairly broad aperture, we then we hone in on areas where we can add the most value.
