SEATTLE, WA (December 9, 2019) – Blue Point Capital Partners (“Blue Point”) announced today the acquisition of its sixth Blue Point IV platform investment, Mattco Forge, Inc. (“Mattco”), a globally recognized designer and manufacturer of quality engineered forged metal products primarily for the aerospace & defense (“A&D”) industry.

Mattco, founded in 1969 and headquartered in Paramount, CA, offers a wide range of products and customized product configurations spanning a comprehensive array of alloys that are critical to high-performance A&D parts.

“Blue Point sees a significant opportunity to grow the Mattco platform,” said Mark Morris, a Partner with Blue Point.  “Together with management and our extensive A&D operating resources, we hope to expand the Company’s production capabilities, improve its supply chain management and enhance its business infrastructure, all while maintaining Mattco’s best-in-class track record of customer service and execution.”

Blue Point has considerable resources along with recent and historical experience in the A&D and metals manufacturing space.  The firm has made several successful investments in A&D, including Selmet, Inc., which was sold in 2018, and its current portfolio investment in Consolidated Precision Products Corp., based in Cleveland, OH.

Rob Lewis, President of Mattco, said, “Our partnership with Blue Point will enable us to build upon our success to date.  The team is eager to benefit from a new, experienced partner while taking Mattco through its next stage of growth."

“Mattco has strategically positioned itself as a key supplier of forged metal products in the A&D industry.  With a focus on innovative engineering, quality, continuous improvement and world-class customer support, Mattco has become the supplier of choice for industry leaders across the globe.  Given our experience and resources, it’s a natural fit,” said Charley Geiger, a Principal with Blue Point.

Lazard served as exclusive financial advisor to Mattco on the transaction.




Mattco Forge, Inc. is a globally recognized leader in the development, design, manufacture and test of quality engineered forged metal products, leveraging decades of experience supplying the world’s premier manufacturers with the highest quality metal forging solutions in the world.  For over fifty years, Mattco has been focused on quality of product, innovative engineering, continuous improvements, customer relationships and best-in-class performance. 

Blue Point Capital Partners is a private equity firm managing over $1.5 billion in committed capital.  With offices in Cleveland, Charlotte, Seattle and Shanghai, Blue Point’s geographical footprint allows it to establish relationships with local and regional entrepreneurs and advisors, while providing the resources of a global organization.  The Blue Point partner group has a 21-year track record of partnering with companies in the lower middle-market to facilitate growth and transformative change.  It is one of only a few middle market private equity firms with a presence in both the United States and Asia, which provides a distinct advantage for its portfolio companies.  Blue Point typically invests in businesses that generate between $20 million and $300 million in revenue.
