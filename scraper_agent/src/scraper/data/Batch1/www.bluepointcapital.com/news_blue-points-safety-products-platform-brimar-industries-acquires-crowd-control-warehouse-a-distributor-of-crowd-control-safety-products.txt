CLEVELAND, O.H. / April 12, 2022 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its BPCP IV portfolio company Brimar Industries have acquired Crowd Control Warehouse (CCW), a Chicago-based designer and distributor of crowd-control, traffic and safety products.

CCW offers a wide array of high-quality safety products through a proprietary e-commerce website, CrowdControlWarehouse.com. With an emphasis on delivering a seamless shopping experience and excellent customer support, the Company specializes in safety products such as barricades, stanchions, belt barriers, signage and traffic control devices. CCW's customers operate in a variety of end markets, including the government, event, construction, retail, distribution and education sectors.

“Blue Point and Brimar’s combined value-add capabilities made our choice extremely simple,” said Brook Park Holdings Managing Partner Mark Palchak, an existing investor in CCW partnering alongside Blue Point and Brimar. “We look forward to building on our strategic growth initiatives and expanding CCW’s e-commerce platform with the additional support, resources and expertise of the Blue Point and Brimar teams.”

Brimar, a manufacturer and distributor of safety signage products and accessories, also reaches customers primarily through well-established e-commerce channels, including SafetySign.com and PipeMarker.com. The alignment of the companies’ digital-forward business models and shared end-markets make CCW a perfect fit for the Brimar safety products platform.

“We are thrilled to welcome the CCW team and customers into the Brimar family,” said Brimar COO Michael Schoenfeld. “The strengths of both organizations combined will be an incredible value-add to our collective customers, and we look forward to working together to achieve our shared growth objectives.”

“CCW has established itself in the crowd control and safety barrier sector. This investment serves as an excellent first step in the M&A expansion strategy we have planned for Brimar as a leading safety products platform,” said Blue Point Principal Rick Soukup. “In addition to M&A, the Blue Point team looks forward to leveraging our Data & Digital and Asia Supply Chain teams to help expand the business.”
