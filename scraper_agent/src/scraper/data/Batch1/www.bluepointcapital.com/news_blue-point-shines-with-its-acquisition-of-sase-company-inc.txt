SEATTLE, WA (August 25, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners, in partnership with management, announced today the acquisition of its eighth Blue Point III platform investment, SASE Company, Inc.  SASE is a leading manufacturer and supplier of equipment and consumables used in the concrete polishing industry.


SASE provides a comprehensive portfolio of high-quality products including grinding machines, vacuums, diamond tooling, abrasives and related products.  The Company, with locations in Rockford, Tennessee, and Kent, Washington, is well-positioned for continued growth due to its industry-leading reputation for technology, quality and superior customer service.


“The acquisition of SASE represents an excellent opportunity to partner with a local company with a strong management team, and acquire a growing business in an attractive industry,” said Mark Morris, a Partner with Blue Point.  “The business fits well with Blue Point’s strategy of partnering with an experienced management team as first institutional investor and where we see ample opportunity for Blue Point to be a value-add partner."

The partnership provides significant opportunities to leverage Blue Point’s value-added resources, such as sourcing and supply chain expertise, data analytics and digital capabilities, and strategic growth resources.


“The SASE management team is excited to partner with Blue Point as we strengthen our leading market position and continue to aggressively pursue opportunities for growth in all facets of our business,” said Jim Weder, President of SASE.  “Blue Point’s value-added capabilities, deep experience with manufacturing and distribution companies, and strategic and operational resources make them an ideal partner for us.”

"Partnering with SASE, a company with a long history of successfully serving its many customers, a very talented team and exciting growth opportunities, is a perfect fit with Blue Point’s portfolio and initiatives,” said Charley Geiger, a Principal with Blue Point.  “We are thrilled to be a part of SASE’s continued success.”
