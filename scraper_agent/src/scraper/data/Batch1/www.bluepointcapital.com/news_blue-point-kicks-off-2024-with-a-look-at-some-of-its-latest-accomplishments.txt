================================================================================
We’re proud of what the team has achieved and incredibly grateful to those who have supported Blue Point through our journey as a firm. It’s a pleasure to celebrate our own Blue Point team and our hard-working portfolio company employees. Please join us in taking a look back at the year that was as we step forward with optimism into another year.

Since 2000, Blue Point’s commitment to investing in lower-middle-market companies in partnership with entrepreneurs and management teams has resulted in:

5 funds raised
$2.5B capital under management
$1.9B in deployed capital
148 deals closed
$9B+ in transaction value

We worked to grow our current platform companies and create lasting value by pursuing strategic organic growth opportunities and M&A.

In 2023, we:

Established our eyewear platform with Europa Eyewear and, shortly after, expanded with the acquisition of eyebobs.
Integrated the exciting addition of Rex Specs to the Weaver Leather platform.
Stedman created a European beachhead for the Next Level Apparel platform.
Grew our general automotive distribution platform at Transtar Industries with the add-ons of Pro Form Products, C&M Auto Parts and Arch Auto Parts.
Expanded the reach of TAS Environmental Services, L.P. through the add-on of Environmental Concepts & Services, Inc.
Grew siffron with the acquisition of Process Retail Group.

We want to extend a special nod to the team members who joined us or were promoted in the last year:


We couldn’t do it without you!

The firm was also acknowledged on a larger scale by our peers and members of the media.

As a team, we received:

Global M&A Network’s M&A Atlas Award for Deal of the Year for our acquisition of Europa
Global M&A Network’s M&A Atlas Award for Lower Mid-Market Firm of the Year
Inc.’s Founder Friendly award for the fourth time
Honorable Mention for 2023 Deal of the Year for our sale of Kendall Vegetation Services by Mergers & Acquisitions.

2023 was an interesting year, to say the least. On behalf of the Blue Point team, we appreciated working with many of you this year and look forward to continued success in 2024.
