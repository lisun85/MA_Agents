CHARLOTTE, NC (August 8, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners announced today that it has sold its interest in OrthoLite to Trilantic North America.  OrthoLite was a portfolio company in Blue Point III – the Firm’s 2014 vintage, $425 million lower middle-market buyout fund.  Sale terms were not disclosed.

“We are extremely proud of the value created at OrthoLite during our hold period; the strength of the management team and business model enabled the Company to more than double earnings while generating significant cash flow,” said Juli Marley, a Partner with Blue Point.  "We assisted Glenn to expand the Company’s global infrastructure and make numerous additions to the management team to support the terrific growth generated during our ownership period.”


Blue Point made its initial investment in April 2014, recognizing the value proposition that OrthoLite provided to its customers.  Glenn and his team created a category and assisted their brand customers to create greater comfort for the end consumer.  Blue Point saw the opportunity to assist in providing human capital and infrastructure to support the Company’s growth.


“Our Company experienced significant momentum while partnered with Blue Point.  Blue Point’s presence in Asia, resources and understanding of our category made them a great first institutional partner for us,” said Glenn Barrett, Chief Executive Officer of OrthoLite.  “We look forward to working with Trilantic North America, and its experience in consumer products, as we continue our global expansion.”


"We feel very fortunate to have partnered with Glenn, Pam and the rest of OrthoLite’s talented management team to recapitalize such a wonderful business,” said Jeff Robich, a Principal with Blue Point.  “We wish them continued success as they enter their next phase of growth with Trilantic North America."
