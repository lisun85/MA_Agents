CLEVELAND, OH (March 2, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners announced today the acquisition of Top of the World, LLC, the leading supplier of collegiate headwear in the United States, and its merger with the Blue Point III platform investment, J. America, Inc.  This represents the first transaction for the J. America platform since Blue Point acquired the investment in March 2016.

J. America and Top of the World will operate as business units under the newly formed parent company, Vetta, LLC.  “By bringing together these two growing and profitable companies, we are creating a powerhouse in the apparel and headwear industry that will be able to better serve our customers and partners,” said Jeff Robich, a Principal at Blue Point.

Chip Chaikin, a Partner with Blue Point, said, “Top of the World is a highly strategic fit with J. America; the Company has an extremely talented management team and the strongest collegiate headwear program in the industry.”

Top of the World, headquartered in Norman, OK, designs, sources, warehouses and distributes fitted and adjustable caps, knit headwear, visors and other accessories that are embellished with licensed collegiate logos to every major tier of retail distribution across the United States.  Top of the World’s business is diversified across 500+ licenses and is the clear industry leader in single-source collegiate headwear licenses, complementing J. America’s leadership in single-source collegiate licenses.

“Blue Point recognized the similar goals of Top of the World and J. America, which is to provide attractive, affordable, high-quality and comfortable products to our customers,” said Scott Shuler, President of Top of the World.  “The combined company will clearly benefit from access to the Asian capabilities, e-commerce expertise and operating resources of Blue Point.”

Jeff Fenech, Co-founder of J. America, added, “This merger is really attractive given the synergistic fit of the two companies.  We are excited for the continued growth in our headwear segment powered by Top of the World’s strong reputation with both licensees and retail customers.”
