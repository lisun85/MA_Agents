Renovus Capital Partners Named as a Recipient of BluWave’s 2025 Top PE Innovator Award

Wayne, Pennsylvania – Renovus Capital Partners has been named as a winner of BluWave’s 2025 Top PE Innovator Award*. BluWave’s fourth annual Top Private Equity Innovator Awards recognize the top 2% of private equity firms that differentially embrace proactive due diligence, transformative value creation, modern private equity firm operations and corporate citizenship practices.

“Innovation in private equity drives competitive advantage, enhances portfolio value, mitigates risk and creates long-term sustainability, helping firms adapt to market changes and achieve superior returns,” said Renovus Founding Partner, Atif Gilani. “We are extremely pleased to be a recipient of BluWave’s prestigious award.”

The Top Private Equity Innovator awardees were selected by a cross-functional committee that assessed candidates in consultation with a broad universe of limited partners, investment bankers, industry thought leaders and service providers in the private equity ecosystem. As part of their selection process, the committee evaluated more than 6,000 private equity firms and utilized more than 75 different factors, incorporating more than 400,000 data points.

“The 2025 top private equity innovators are providing differential leadership in the world of business,” said Sean Mooney, founder and CEO of BluWave. “Their innovative practices are strengthening companies, creating jobs and catalyzing our economy.”

The Top Private Equity Innovator Awards are distinctive in that they involve no financial obligations from any participants and the selection process is independent of any customer relationships.
