Renovus Capital Partners’ Portfolio Company F2 Strategy Appoints Former Orion Executive and Proven Industry Operator Ryan Beach as CEO

CHICAGO – F2 Strategy (“F2”), a leading wealth management technology and marketing services consultancy, today announced the appointment of industry veteran Ryan Beach as chief executive officer. The recruitment of Beach represents the latest in a series of strategic personnel additions that include Laura Korbel as president and Jay Halbert as chief financial officer.

F2 has undergone a period of rapid expansion in the past 18 months, following a majority investment from private equity firm Renovus Capital Partners (“Renovus”). This growth has necessitated the strategic addition of top industry talent to the leadership team to sustain F2’s strong momentum. In the latest executive appointment, Ryan Beach will succeed co-founder Doug Fritz as CEO. Fritz will transition to the role of executive chairman, allowing him to focus his efforts on strategic initiatives and client engagements.

“We couldn’t be happier that Ryan has agreed to come on board at F2,” said Fritz. “We’ve already exceeded our aggressive growth targets, and Ryan has the exact experience we need to help fuel the next stage of our evolution. His leadership as CEO will allow me to focus on what I’m most passionate about—working hands-on with our clients and shaping the future of the industry.”

At Orion, Beach served in executive leadership roles in both technology and wealth management while executing on Orion’s M&A initiatives. During his nearly 13-year tenure at Orion, he advanced through several leadership positions to become chief operating officer and eventually president of Orion Wealth Management. His C-suite experience includes driving strategic growth and expanding service offerings through a servant leadership style that emphasizes team development and fosters a culture of empowerment, collaboration and accountability.

“I’ve long admired F2 Strategy’s thoughtful approach to helping the wealth management industry adapt to a rapid pace of change,” said Beach. “During my time at Orion, I saw firsthand the value F2 brought as a partner, delivering innovative solutions and real-world insights. I’m excited to join co-founders Doug and Liz Fritz and their team in continuing to drive growth and helping clients bridge the gap between expectations and capabilities in meaningful and impactful ways.”

Beach is committed to transforming financial services by leveraging disruptive technologies, improving operational efficiency and delivering value to clients and stakeholders alike. His forward-looking approach emphasizes ethical practices, transparency and a client-centric focus, supporting sustainable growth and meaningful contributions to the broader community.

“This is an exciting time for F2 Strategy, and Ryan is the right leader to guide the company through its next phase of growth,” said Renovus Managing Director Lee Minkoff . “His experience at a large organization like Orion equips him to strengthen operations and build on the strong foundation that Doug and Liz have created. With Ryan at the helm, Doug can focus on the areas where he excels, ensuring F2 continues to deliver exceptional value to its clients.”

F2 established its new headquarters in Chicago last year and maintains additional offices in New York and St. Louis. With an organizational headcount of over 100 employees and a network of 3,600 consultants globally, F2 now services a client base collectively representing more than $3.8 trillion in assets under management (AUM).
