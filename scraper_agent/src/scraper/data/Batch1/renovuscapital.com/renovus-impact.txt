INTEGRATING ESG FACTORS INTO OUR INVESTING
About Our Impact Strategy

Since its inception in 2010, Renovus has remained steadfast in its mission to invest in responsibly run small businesses that offer innovative solutions and simultaneously improve our society. We integrate ESG factors into our investment analysis and decision-making processes pre-investment and post-investment when we engage with our portfolio companies on risks or opportunities.

Renovus supports its portfolio companies in certain social impact goals, such as 1) diversity of workforce, management, and ownership, 2) job creation and job improvement, and 3) education, human capital growth, and upskilling. We believe that ESG factors are material to our long-term success and that integrating them into our decision-making will help us to create a more sustainable and prosperous future for our portfolio companies and our investors. We are pleased to present Renovus Capital’s 2023 Impact Report, which reflects our commitment to transparency in communicating our progress.
