Renovus Capital Partners Announces Strategic Partnership with Superior Health Holdings

WAYNE, PA – Renovus Capital Partners (“Renovus”) today announced a strategic partnership with Superior Health Holdings, Inc. (“Superior” or the “Company”), a leading provider of home health and hospice services throughout Louisiana.

Superior offers skilled nursing care, therapy services and home health aides within the comfort of its clients’ homes. Demand for Superior’s services is robust and growing, driven by the aging US population, while there has been a push from payors to move costs out of hospitals to home health and hospice care. The Company’s staff consists of highly skilled nurses, aides, social workers, and physical, occupational and speech therapists. Superior was formed in 2021 as an aggregation of several agencies providing similar services throughout Louisiana and has since grown both organically and through strategic acquisitions, led by Chief Executive Officer, David Martin.

“We are excited to partner with the seasoned and accomplished team at Renovus as we look forward to bringing Superior’s high-quality and compassionate care to more patients and families across the region,” said David Martin.

“David and his team have established a strong leadership position in the growing home health and hospice care space in Louisiana with a unique focus on compassion for the people they serve,” said Jesse Serventi, Founding Partner at Renovus. “We are proud to support a dedicated team as we seek to advance the important impact Superior is making for people who choose to receive care in the comfort of their homes, while also growing to reach new communities in Louisiana and neighboring states.”

Edgemont Partners served as exclusive financial advisor and Polsinelli as legal counsel to Superior. Brentwood Capital Advisors served as financial advisor and DLA Piper as legal counsel to Renovus. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
