To exercise these rights and controls, please contact the Chief Compliance Officer of Soundcore at azuckerman@soundcorecap.com.

Access: You have the right to ask for a copy of the personal information that we hold about you free of charge, however we may charge a “reasonable fee,” if we think that your request is excessive, to help us cover the costs of locating the information you have requested.

Correction: You may notify us of changes to your personal information if it is inaccurate or it needs to be updated.

Deletion: If you think that we should not be holding or processing your personal information any more, you may request that we delete it. Please note that this may not always be possible due to legal obligations.

Restrictions on use: You may request that we stop processing your personal information (other than storing it), if: (i) you contest the accuracy of it (until the accuracy is verified); (ii) you believe the processing is against the law; (iii) you believe that we no longer need your data for the purposes for which it was collected, but you still need your data to establish or defend a legal claim; or (iv) you object to the processing, and we are verifying whether our legitimate grounds to process your personal information, override your own rights.

Portability: If you wish to transfer your personal information to another organization (and certain conditions are satisfied), you may ask us to do so, and we will send it directly if we have the technical means.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We reserve the right to amend this EU Privacy Policy from time to time by updating this EU Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our EU Privacy Policy, we will post those changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to collect personal information or use any collected information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify applicable users. We will use information only in accordance with this EU Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.
