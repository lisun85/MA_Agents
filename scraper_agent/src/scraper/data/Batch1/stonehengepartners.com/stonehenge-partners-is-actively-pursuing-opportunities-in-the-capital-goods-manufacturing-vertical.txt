Stonehenge Partners is Actively Pursuing Opportunities in the Capital Goods Manufacturing Vertical

Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”), a private equity firm based in Columbus, Ohio, is actively pursuing investment opportunities in the capital goods manufacturing vertical. Stonehenge has considerable experience partnering with capital goods manufacturers and has identified the space as a vertical of particular interest. Stonehenge recently partnered with Dan Brown, an industry veteran and the former President of Hamer-Fischbein, to pursue opportunities as a value-added partner in terms of investment experience and operational expertise.

For over 25 years, Stonehenge has provided flexible equity and debt solutions in partnership with entrepreneurs and management teams who maintain a strong market position and competitive advantage. Stonehenge’s approach provides strategic assistance without operational interference, allowing management teams to execute post-closing growth strategies and reinvest equity proceeds. Stonehenge’s typical check size ranges from $10 million to $50 million.

If you have information regarding strategic acquisitions and new investment opportunities, please contact Patrick Shevelson (pbshevelson@stonehengepartners.com) at (614) 246-2465.
