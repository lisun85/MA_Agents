Stonehenge Partners Supports Acquisition of Plastic Package, Inc. by Revere Packaging Holdings, LLC

July 2017:  Stonehenge Partners supported the acquisition of Plastic Package, Inc. (“PPI”) by Revere Packaging Holdings, LLC (“Revere”).

Located in Shelbyville, Kentucky and a platform company of Progress Equity Partners (“Progress”), Revere is a niche provider of single use aluminum and plastic packaging solutions in unique order quantities on a made-to-order basis. Revere is active in many end markets including airline, bakery, food distribution, frozen food, restaurant and supermarkets.

Located in Sacramento, California, PPI produces thin-gauge thermoformed plastic trays and containers for confectionery, bakery, food service, school nutrition, and other food-centric end markets.

The newly-combined company is positioned to respond to food packaging demand (including growth in functional and custom packaging) through the integration of highly-experienced industry executives, the application of state-of-the-art technologies, and the consistent delivery of exceptional customer service. In addition, the new company will serve a larger clientele with broader product offerings from locations in Hawaii, California, Indiana and Kentucky.
