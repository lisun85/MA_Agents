Stonehenge Partners Provides Minority Equity and Junior Capital Solutions Amidst Market Uncertainty

Stonehenge is a Flexible Fund that Provides Minority Equity and Junior Capital Solutions in Addition to Majority Equity

For over 20 years, Stonehenge Partners has supported lower middle market companies by providing equity (majority and minority) and debt. Given the current contraction in the lending markets, Stonehenge Partners can serve as a unique financing partner that offers patient capital for lower middle market businesses. Potential advantages and considerations include the following:

Growth Capital – Provides businesses with capital to deliver on growth plans prior to a sale.
Junior Debt Financing – Provides unitranche and/or subordinated debt structures that bridge the gap beyond what traditional lenders are providing in the current market.
Patient Capital Structure – Provides management more autonomy to execute on growth initiatives post-closing.
Flexible Solutions – Provides a variety of equity and debt solutions throughout the entire capital structure.

Stonehenge has been providing equity and debt solutions to lower middle market businesses for 20+ years. We remain committed to partnering with great companies and executing quickly in the current market environment.
