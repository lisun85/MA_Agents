2023 Year in Review

Thank You to Our Partners

Founded in 1999, this year marked our 24th year of partnering with and providing solutions to entrepreneurs, family / founder owned businesses, and sponsors across the lower middle market. We continue to be grateful for our loyal investor base, as well as the strength of our relationships across the market.

We had another strong year as we stayed active with several new platform investments as well as multiple add-on acquisitions for our existing portfolio companies. In aggregate, the firm deployed over $100 million of capital during the year. We also successfully exited our position in PPM Technologies, which was acquired by Duravant LLC.

As we begin 2024 and look to the year ahead, we are excited to continue to partner with exceptional management teams, build winning organizations, and create shareholder value. The below outlines our key milestones from the past year. We thank our partners across the middle market and look forward to working with you on new opportunities this year.
