Crescendo invests in Peltram Plumbing
Crescendo Capital Partners, LLC (“Crescendo”) is pleased to announce its investment in Peltram Plumbing, LLC (“Peltram” or the “Company”), the leading plumbing-focused mechanical contractor in the Seattle area.

“
Crescendo is exactly what we were looking for in a partner. They have significant expertise growing small businesses, specifically in the trades. They have a long-term focus and respect the culture we’ve worked hard to maintain.

Karel Peltram

Management retains a significant equity position in Peltram. Founded in 1985 and based in Auburn, WA, Peltram works primarily on new construction projects for both single-family (“S/F”) and multi-family (“M/F”) residential units.

“
We are grateful to partner with Karel and the Peltram team. We are backing one of the best-managed plumbing/mechanical contracting businesses in the Western US. We are excited to work with the team to continue to provide top-level service to customers and to assist in the next phase of growth for the Company.
