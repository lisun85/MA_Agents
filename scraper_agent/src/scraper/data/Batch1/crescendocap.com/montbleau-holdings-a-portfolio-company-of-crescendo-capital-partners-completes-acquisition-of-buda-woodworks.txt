Montbleau Holdings, LLC (“Montbleau”) is pleased to announce its acquisition of Buda Woodworks, LLC (“Buda”) from A.P. Brashear Group. Based in Austin, TX, Buda designs, fabricates and installs architectural millwork and casework primarily for commercial applications. The Buda acquisition adds another market leader and strong management team to the platform and expands Montbleau’s footprint into four large and growing TX MSAs. The combined company, comprised of Montbleau & Associates, Northwest Woodworks and Buda Woodworks, is one of the largest architectural millwork firms in the country with experience across a wide variety of end-markets and expertise to execute the largest, most high-profile projects.

Callodine Strategic Credit and Muzinich & Co. provided junior debt to support the transaction, while First Merchants Bank increased their line of credit commitment.

Kent Cook, CEO of Buda commented, “It’s an exciting time for the Buda Woodworks team. With the resources of the Montbleau platform behind us, we believe we can accelerate growth and provide both additional opportunities for our team and additional solutions for our clients”.

Joel Gaynor, Crescendo Principal and Montbleau board member noted,”It has been a great pleasure getting to know the team behind excellent workmanship and reputation of Buda. We, Montbleau and Crescendo, look forward to partnering with them and discovering what Buda can accomplish in the coming years”.

“It is very exciting to witness the continued and rapid growth of the Montbleau platform. Buda is an outstanding addition and further proof that Montbleau is an acquirer of choice in the architectural millwork industry”, Michael MacRitchie, Crescendo Partner and Montbleau Board Chairman, added.
