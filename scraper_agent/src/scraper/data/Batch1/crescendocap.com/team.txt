Why Partner With Us?

General

We do what we say.
We don’t change stripes after a deal closes.
We invest our personal capital (in most deals, 75-100% of the capital is ours).
We intensely focus on company culture.
We develop a collegial workplace, respecting everyone’s contributions.
We specialize in scaling profitable mid-size firms with proven market demand.

Some Specifics

We bring seasoned operating partners to work with management teams, focused on strategic growth initiatives.
We bring financial partners to help build robust financial reporting and cash management systems.
We find creative ways to drive growth.
We take care of our employees (because they take care of our customers, and our customers take care of us).
We drive scale and end-market/geographic diversification through an overt, hands-on M&A strategy. Often, 1+1+1=5.
