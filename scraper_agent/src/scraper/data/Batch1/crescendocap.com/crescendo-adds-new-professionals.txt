In the last 18 months, Crescendo adds fifth, sixth and seventh investment professionals, plus its first Operating Partner

In FY21, Crescendo added Joel Gaynor, a VP in the Chicago office.  Joel joined Crescendo from OFS Capital Corporation where he initially led valuation efforts prior to joining the direct credit/equity investment team; in addition to OFS, he was a valuation professional at KPMG.  Joel holds an MBA and MIS from Boston University and a BA from Central Michigan.

In early FY22, Crescendo added its second Austin professional, Bryan Miller, SVP.  Bryan worked with two PE firms, Pegasus Capital Group and Revolution Capital Group in Los Angeles, then had investment banking roles with Wells Fargo in Los Angeles and KPMG in Austin.  Bryan holds a BA from Yale University and an MBA from UCLA.

Very recently, Crescendo added Ryan Demouth, an Associate in a new Dallas office.  Ryan was previously with Prospect Capital Management, which he joined after working with Prudential’s fixed income and private credit groups in Dallas and Newark.  Ryan holds a BBA from the University of Georgia.

Additionally, Crescendo added its first Operating Partner, Gary Baughman.  Gary has 30+ years of operational experience in the engineering, construction and environmental services sectors through leadership roles in sales, marketing, finance, operations and executive management.   He led the Americas group at M+W and the Industrial group at AECOM.  He also led APTIM as CEO, a $2B construction management firm owned by a private equity firm.  Gary holds a BS-Accounting from the Clemson University.  He is a NACD-certified BOD director.

As a result, Crescendo now has professionals in Austin (2), Charlotte (1), Chicago (4) and Dallas (1).
