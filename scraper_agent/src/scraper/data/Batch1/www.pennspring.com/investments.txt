THE SPRING

Spring is the time of new beginnings, of growth awakened, of limitless potential. This is the embodiment of what PennSpring Capital brings to business owners and industry executives alike. We believe that care and commitment are as central to success as are discipline and diligence, and our track record supports this unique people-forward approach to private equity.

The Resources to Close. The Support to Scale.

Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based PennSpring is specifically engineered to assist companies that are not quite ready for institutional capital. Specifically, we specialize in elevating companies with EBITDA of $750,000 - $5 million to the next tier of $5 million and beyond - and thus positioned for an institutional audience. With a robust rolodex of ways to finance transactions, including direct investment, we can close quickly.


Through this process we give company owners their desired measure of liquidity and, perhaps more importantly, "a second bite at a larger apple". With the potential exception of retirement scenarios, we strongly prefer that the entrepreneur "rollover" a meaningful stake (20 - 45% of the company). PennSpring principals invest and provide critical advisory services and strategic connections, but we do not meddle in the day-to-day operations of the company…we align with expert management for a reason.

Testimonials

“PennSpring was an incredible steward of our organization. Under their ownership we tripled EBITDA in just 19 months, and achieved an outlier outcome for all shareholders. Moreover, they accomplished this without altering our company culture; even at the point of sale they proved adept at uncovering the perfect buyer – not only strategically, but also as a cultural fit for our Amish/English workforce.”

- Nate Eisenberg, COO Swing Kingdom

"They delivered what they promised every step of the way. Lou was instrumental in professionalizing our business and providing a superior return for all, via our successful exit to Blue Star Sports - a portfolio company of GenStar Capital."

- Jason Frazier, CEO Skyhawks Sports

"The experience of working with Lou and group revolutionized BEAME Lighting. Together with our management team we took the company to the next level, and we could not have been more pleased with our successful exit to 4Wall Entertainment, a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners."

- Brad Clark, CEO BEAME Lighting
