Titan is a carve-out of the North American oil and gas production equipment assets of Exterran Corp. (NYSE: EXTN)\n\nTitan is the fifth platform acquisition for the Branford Castle Fund, which had its final close in October 2016. \u201cWhile we have been investing for 30 years, Branford has grown rapidly since forming our first institutional fund a little over a year ago,\u201d said John S. Castle, President and CEO of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cWe are committed to generating superior returns for our investors by making disciplined investments and working alongside management teams to further develop great companies.\u201d\n\nTitan is a market leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of oil and gas production equipment used to separate, process and treat hydrocarbon streams at the wellhead, gathering and processing stages of production. Former and current managers of Titan\u2019s operations under Exterran, led by CEO Chris Werner and Senior Vice President Michael Collins, are investors in Titan and will operate the new business going forward. Titan is differentiated by its strong in-house design and engineering capabilities and its ability to produce and deliver high volumes of large, complex and customized products.\n\n\u201cTitan is Branford\u2019s second platform acquisition this month. We continue to move rapidly to deploy investors\u2019 capital to grow our portfolio of dynamic companies,\u201d said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cTitan is a particularly attractive investment because of the recent recovery of North American oil and gas drilling activity and the need for Titan\u2019s equipment in its markets. As part of the transaction, Titan will become Exterran\u2019s preferred supplier of production equipment for its U.S. and Canadian operations.\u201d\n\nWerner said, \u201cExterran\u2019s production business developed a powerful market reputation over the years, largely because of the strong local workforce in Columbus, Texas. We are going to maintain this continuity in both labor and experience as the business escalates production.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of Titan follows Branford\u2019s acquisition of:\n\nDrew Foam Companies, Inc., a leading provider of custom-fabricated expanded polystyrene foam (\u201cEPS\u201d) products serving the packaging, building products and consumer end-markets, primarily in the Southeastern United States;\nVitrek, a leading manufacturer of sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment;\nSurface Preparation Technologies, the leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety;\nEarthlite Massage Tables, the world\u2019s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and\nContinuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.\n\nTerms of the Titan transaction were not disclosed.

The company, founded in 1965, offers quick turnaround for customers who often demand just-in-time (\u201cJIT\u201d) delivery for products.

Castle, a managing partner of\u00a0Branford Castle Partners. \u201cThe lines are out the door,\u201d said Castle, who had to push his way through a crowd of people to meet me.\n\nWhy were a group of well-dressed executives queued up outside in the heat Monday? To buy a salad. I won\u2019t disclose which fast food chain it was. Castle and I tallied up the various salad-related establishments that are seemingly gobbling up Manhattan. There\u2019s\u00a0Just Salad,\u00a0sweetgreen,\u00a0Essen Slow Fast Food\u00a0and, of course,\u00a0Chop\u2019t. I confessed I\u2019m a Just Salad member.\n\nCastle, who said he has no vested interest in salad, said it was Chop\u2019t that started the craze. He wondered if the lines outside were really just a matter of getting customers out the door faster. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Chop\u2019t] created a real category here. This is just an observation,\u201d he said.\n\nFor lunch, since we were focused on it, we both had chopped salads (but not from Chop\u2019t). We finally talked about what we were meant to discuss: Branford Castle Partners, the former family office that chose in 2015 to morph into a private equity firm. Castle, who joined in 2002, said the firm decided to make the switch because it \u201cwanted more.\u201d\n\nThe GP combined its own money, along with family office and institutional funding, to raise its first pool. In October, Branford Castle Partners announced the final close of its $116 million debut fund. \u201cWe wanted to take the next step,\u201d Castle said of the switch to PE. \u201cWe wanted more.\u201d\n\nThe lower-middle-market PE firm, a generalist investor, has done two deals so far:\u00a0Surface Preparation Technologies\u00a0in February and\u00a0Earthlite Massage Tables\u00a0last year. Branford Castle Partners will invest up to $20 million to $25 million in companies with EBITDA between $1.5 million and $15 million.\n\nThe biggest difference between a family office and a PE firm? You have to put money to work, said Castle.\n\nCastle wouldn\u2019t say if he was interested in investing in a salad chain.",
