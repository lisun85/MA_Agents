"I have had the pleasure of working with the Charter Oak group since 2006. Most impressive is their integrity. We have developed a terrific partnership that is based on mutual trust and respect, and they always do what they say they are going to do. Their involvement has resulted in the best years in our company history."
– Larry Derose, Founder & Former CEO; Cirtec Medical Systems
Working With Us

Partnering with strong management teams is central to our investment thesis. Charter Oak Equity's approach to working with management teams is based on collaboration and support. We believe that we can create the most value by combining our operational acumen, financial expertise and capital with management's industry knowledge and operating expertise.

Although all of our partners have run companies, it is not our intent to run the companies we acquire. However, we recognize that a portfolio company may sometimes have opportunities or challenges that are outside the current expertise of its management team or the company may be at an inflection point in its growth where new processes or capabilities are required to help it realize its full potential. When we encounter these situations, we take a high level of hands-on responsibility to help our management team work through their options and implement solutions.

The partners at Charter Oak Equity invest in each of our deals and we always invite our management teams to invest alongside us. In addition, we develop strong financial incentives for management to ensure that we have a common interest in producing exceptional returns for our investors.
