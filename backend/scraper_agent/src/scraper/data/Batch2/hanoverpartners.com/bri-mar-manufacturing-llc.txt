Company Description

Bri-Mar Manufacturing, LLC is a leading manufacturer of light-duty hydraulic dump trailers, equipment transport trailers, and utility trailers serving a variety of contractor markets including landscape and construction services. Founded in 1995 and located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Bri-Mar is a recognized leader in the hydraulic dump trailer market with a widely recognized brand, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The Company has built a nationwide dealer network, now numbering greater than 200, enabling strong sales growth since its founding.  Continued channel development coupled with innovative product introductions will drive Bri-Mar’s continued success.

Hanover Partners joined with the Company’s president to acquire Bri-Mar from a private equity group. In a successful exit for investors and management, Hanover sold Bri-Mar to a strategic buyer in late 2013.
