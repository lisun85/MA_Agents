About Hanover Partners

Andrew Ford and John Palmer founded Hanover Partners in 1994. As operating professionals with product management, marketing, business strategy, and strategic finance backgrounds, they saw an opportunity to leverage their operating experience to acquire, manage, and grow a small company. This approach transitioned into a portfolio model where they would not get involved in the day-to-day operations of the companies; rather, they would be value-added investor-partners, providing engaged, resourceful stewardship for the management teams of each acquired company. As such, we have been highly selective with our acquisitions so that we can devote meaningful time to supporting each portfolio company.

While the specific sub-sectors in which we have invested vary, the commonality is companies that are niche market leaders, develop proprietary products and equipment or software, maintain a heavy focus on R&D, have talented, ownership oriented management teams, and have the potential to grow into larger organizations.
