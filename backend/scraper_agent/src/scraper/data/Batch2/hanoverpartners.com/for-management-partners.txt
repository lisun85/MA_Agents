================================================================================
In our view and from our experience, the caliber of the management team and the alignment of interests with the management team is one of  the most critical factors in the success of growing small-to-medium sized companies. Our philosophy is that market leading businesses are built by management, not by investors; therefore, we are disciplined in our approach that management retain full operational control. We endeavor to be thoughtful, resourceful, and supportive custodians of the private companies and family businesses we acquire. Accordingly, we offer selling owners the assurance that we will build upon the legacy they have worked so hard to create. Our interests are in helping small companies further realize their potential and we do that by building larger organizations in partnership with management.

Over our twenty-year history, we have worked with owners, sellers, and management teams across a wide spectrum of company leadership and transaction rationale scenarios. We are highly experienced in and comfortable with partnering with existing management, facilitating management transitions, recruiting new management to strengthen an existing team and/or fill organizational gaps, and backing outside managers who are looking for capital to acquire a company or division of a larger business, or execute upon an investment thesis.

For Owners Seeking to Retain Partial Ownership and Remain Business Leaders

Many of investments have been structured as a “recapitalization”, whereby owners who are also the leaders of the business seek to realize several different objectives in one transaction, including:

Achieve significant liquidity but remain a meaningful shareholder so as to participate in the future upside of the business, retain management independence and full operational autonomy and remain in their current leadership roles, as well benefit from the support of an experienced financial and business partner in Hanover to assist in pursuing management’s growth objectives.
Cash-out inactive and/or retiring shareholders and achieve a more consolidated ownership structure.
Expand company ownership opportunities to additional management team members and employees.
Access growth capital to pursue a variety of organic initiatives such as facility and plant expansion, product line extensions, new product introductions, geographic expansion of the customer base, entry to new or adjacent market verticals, etc.
Execute an add-on/tuck-in acquisition growth strategy.
For Owners Seeking a Full Company Sale and a Management Transition

We are highly experienced in ensuring that business owners who are looking to sell all of their company and/or retire have a new owner in Hanover Partners that will act as a supportive steward of the business and build upon the tradition that the owner and employees have established. No transaction is the same and our flexible approach is tailored to meet the unique needs of each specific owner. For owners seeking a full liquidity, we offer:

Expertise in facilitating ownership transitions when an existing management team is already in place and an owner is seeking to retire post-transaction; including, backing the existing leadership team if the owner has removed himself or herself from day-to-day operations, or promoting existing senior managers to leadership roles and structuring opportunities for those managers to receive significant ownership.
Expertise in recruiting outside management to replace the retiring owner if the next CEO is not currently in the business.  Typically, we carve out a significant amount of the common equity to recruit, retain, and incentivize high-caliber operators. We maintain a large network of CEO, COO, and CFO candidates, as well as have relationships with specialized executive recruiting firms.
Expertise in working with owners seeking a gradual transition of leadership over several years after the transaction.
Experience in managing the complexities and nuances of family business transitions and generational transfers.
Generally, all cash transactions with high certainty of close and a fluid deal process.
Twenty-year history of keeping companies in their present locations, respecting the company culture, and supporting the growth of the business into a larger organization.
For Executives Looking for a Financial Partner for Capital to Acquire a Company or Division or Pursue an Investment Thesis

We are always seeking to meet with experienced, motivated, ownership-oriented executives who need both capital and a seasoned business and financial partner to execute a management buyout of a stand-alone company, division of a larger business, or “spin-out”/”carve-out” of a public company. In addition, we are excited to meet with operating executives who have an investment thesis and need a financial partner to assist in sourcing, executing, and financing an acquisition strategy.
