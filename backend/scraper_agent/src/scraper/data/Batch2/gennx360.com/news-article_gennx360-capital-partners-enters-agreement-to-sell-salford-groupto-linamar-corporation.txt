New York, New York.  GenNx360 Capital Partners ("GenNx360"), a New York-based private equity firm, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its portfolio company, Salford Group ("Salford" or “the Company”), a leading manufacturer of tillage and crop nutrition application equipment, to Linamar Corporation (TSX:LNR) ("Linamar"), for $260 million CAD, subject to post-closing adjustments.
