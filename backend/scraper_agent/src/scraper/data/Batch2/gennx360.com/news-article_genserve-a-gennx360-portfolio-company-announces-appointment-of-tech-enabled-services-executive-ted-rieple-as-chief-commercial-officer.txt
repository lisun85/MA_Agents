GenServe, a GenNx360 Portfolio Company, Announces Appointment of Tech-Enabled Services Executive Ted Rieple as Chief Commercial Officer
Portfolio Company News - December 05, 2022

New York, New York. GenServe, the leading independent provider of scheduled and emergency power generator services, is pleased to announce today its appointment of Ted Rieple as Chief Commercial Officer. Mr. Rieple will be responsible for the company’s full range of sales, marketing, and organic growth initiatives. 

Mr. Rieple joined the GenServe Board in 2021 after serving as the top-ranking sales executive at Park Place Technologies (“PPT”) for almost 12 years. PPT provides IT infrastructure maintenance services to data centers and employs a business model that is very similar to GenServe’s. PPT’s market position is also based on providing outstanding maintenance and emergency services to ensure that data centers perform to world-class uptime standards. Mr. Rieple was initially PPT’s Executive Vice President for Sales & Marketing and ultimately its Chief Sales Officer as it grew from a lower middle-market domestic business to a $600+ million international enterprise. He has deep experience driving organic growth and building sales teams in a dynamic, field-service-based business.

“Ted has a thorough understanding of our business and has built strong relationships across GenServe as a Director. He knows what it takes to scale a sales organization that can deliver consistent double-digit organic growth and we are thrilled that he is joining our leadership team,” said Fred Smagorinsky, GenServe’s CEO. 

“We are delighted that Ted is coming onboard to serve as GenServe’s first CCO and lead the next phase of its growth. Sustaining organic growth and continuing to build out GenServe’s operating platform through M&A are critical to the company’s value creation strategy,” said Daphne Dufresne, Managing Partner of GenNx360 Capital Partners. 

“I’m very excited to join the GenServe team. The company has established a reputation as the independent provider of choice in the generator services industry. We have a huge opportunity in front of us to extend that market leadership position in existing and new geographies as well as through new service offerings,” said Ted Rieple.
