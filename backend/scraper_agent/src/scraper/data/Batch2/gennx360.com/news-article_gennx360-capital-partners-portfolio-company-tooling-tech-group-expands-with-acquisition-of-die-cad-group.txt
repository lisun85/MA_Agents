GenNx360 Capital Partners’ Portfolio Company Tooling Tech Group Expands with Acquisition of Die Cad Group
Portfolio Company News - June 08, 2018


New York, New York. June 8, 2018 - GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm investing in middle market business-to-business industrial manufacturing and business services companies, is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Tooling Tech Group (“TTG”), has completed the acquisition of Die Cad Group (“DCG”). The acquisition is the fourth for Tooling Tech Group since GenNx360’s investment in the platform in July of 2014.  


Die Cad Group is a global engineering company specializing in tooling design and simulation for the metalworking industry. Founded in 1995, DCG has grown under the leadership of Bobbie Blanton to become a leading provider of engineering services, including tool and die design, mold design, special machine design, transfer press simulation, die details sourcing, product and process simulation and other related services.
“Die Cad Group’s engineering service offerings and their experienced staff are a perfect addition to Tooling Tech Group’s existing proficiencies,” said Tony Seger, TTG CEO. “With this acquisition, our ability to provide a continuum of services from tooling design to simulation, manufacturing, production and even secondary automation is unmatched in the industry. We look forward to enhancing our customers’ experiences through this extensive single source capability.”


“Our partnership with Tooling Tech Group will provide long-term stability and growth opportunities for Die Cad Group, as well as enable us to expand our service offerings,” said Blanton. “Our management team is excited and remains focused on supporting our customers with great service, which is still our top priority. We felt this was a perfect fit for us because there was virtually no overlap between our current customer base and TTG’s. We’ve built our reputation by helping our customers solve the industry’s most complex problems and we will continue to do so.”
Headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Die Cad Group also has offices in Byron Center and Greenville, Michigan and an established customer base among OEM and other suppliers in the automotive, off-highway, furniture, and white goods industries.
