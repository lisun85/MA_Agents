Portfolio Company News - October 03, 2016

GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”) is pleased to announce that its portfolio company, Truck Bodies & Equipment International Inc. ("TBEI"), has acquired Travis Body & Trailer Inc. (“Travis”) on September 30, 2016. Travis, based in Houston, Texas, is a manufacturer of aluminum end dumps, bottom dumps and transfer trailers to the construction, waste and recycling, rendering and agriculture end markets.  Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

“This acquisition is consistent with our expansion into the dump trailer market, an expansion that began in 2013 when TBEI entered this market with a line of steel dump trailers designed, manufactured and marketed under the Ox Trailer brand. TBEI is excited to bring together two of the most trusted brands in the industry,” stated Bob Fines, President and Chief Executive Officer of TBEI.

“This acquisition further strengthens the GenNx360 truck body and trailer platform bringing expertise in aluminum dump trailers and dump bodies, expansion into the southwest, a strong and loyal dealer network and a leading position in the trailer market.
