GenNx360’s Portfolio Company, Precision Aviation Group, Inc. Continues to Expand its Acquisition Strategy with EFIX Aviation Support
Portfolio Company News - October 28, 2020


New York, New York: October 28, 2020 -  GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”) is pleased to announce its portfolio company, Precision Aviation Group, Inc. (“PAG”), has acquired Brazil-based EFIX Aviation Support (“EFIX”). This is the third acquisition for PAG, since GenNx360 took a controlling interest in PAG in 2018. 
 
EFIX specializes in Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services for the South American aerospace and defense market. The company’s diverse capabilities include landing gear, hydraulic/pneumatic, electrical accessories, starter generators, batteries, and avionics. EFIX’s repair station holds both ANAC and EASA certifications.
 
David Mast, President & CEO of PAG stated, “We are excited about the acquisition of EFIX and look forward to working with the EFIX Team as we continue to expand our MRO and supply chain services in Latin America. The addition of EFIX gives PAG its 11th repair station globally and further diversifies PAG’s MRO capabilities by expanding our services into landing gear, hydraulic and pneumatic component services. Additionally, EFIX expands PAG’s footprint in Brazil, where we’ve had a presence since 2015, enabling our customers to benefit from in-country MRO support and expanded local inventory levels, quicker turnaround times, and expanded AOG support.”
 
Ricardo Malato, President of EFIX, said, “David Mast and the PAG team have built a reputation for industry-leading customer service and capabilities. The acquisition by PAG enables EFIX to provide enhanced capabilities for our customers specifically in avionics, LCD display repairs, accessories, instruments, fuel components, and wheels/brakes. These capabilities are supported by our immediate access to PAG’s inventory valued at more than $45 million (USD), including products from over 80 OEM’s. PAG is well positioned and services very diverse end markets and we look forward to building on its strong foundation by helping it grow and meet evolving customer needs.”
