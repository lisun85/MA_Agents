GenNx360 Capital Partners Announces Salford Group’s Third Add-on Acquisition
Portfolio Company News - December 21, 2015

GenNx360 Capital Partners II, L.P. is pleased to announce that Salford Group ("Salford") has acquired the AerWay advanced aeration products line (“AerWay”) from SAF-Holland Canada Limited.  The transaction closed on December 11, 2015 and represents Salford’s third acquisition in the past 14 months. The AerWay acquisition expands Salford’s niche tillage product lineup to offer more vertical tillage and pastureland management tools that appeal to livestock and mixed farming customers.

Salford is a manufacturer of tillage, seeding and fertilizer application equipment. AerWay comes to Salford from SAF-Holland Canada Limited who originally started selling AerWay in 1983. Salford and AerWay have worked well together in the past as AerWay tools already use Salford harrow packages and AerWay is capable of carrying Salford Valmar attachments.
 With close proximity to Salford’s Ontario headquarters, AerWay will continue to produce equipment in its Norwich, Ontario facility. Plans also include shared distribution centers to ensure the widest availability of all products globally.

“We are very pleased to bring AerWay products under the Salford tillage umbrella,” said Geof Gray, Chief Executive Officer of Salford Group. “Both companies focus on innovative designs to meet customer needs, create tools with multi-use capabilities and emphasize soil productivity and management, with vertical tillage/minimal disturbance tools and topdressing or cover cropping being an important part of that,” he said.

Kim Baechler, President of SAF-Holland Canada Limited states, “This is truly an exciting opportunity for the AerWay product line, and many of the employees that help build AerWay. Under Salford’s world class banner, continued investment in the AerWay design and manufacturing will be assured, allowing the product to grow and help farmers and ranchers solve their unique problems.”

"This transaction is our third add-on acquisition, further enhancing GenNx360’s commitment to and investment in the Salford platform," stated Matt Guenther, the GenNx360 Partner who led the transaction.
