Portfolio Company News - August 31, 2009

GenNx360 Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on industrial business-to-business companies with $100 million to $1 billion in revenues, announced today that it has acquired Clariant Corporationâ€™s Specialty Silicones business, which has been renamed SiVance, LLC.

The business employs approximately 120 people and operates out of its facility located in Gainesville, Florida.

"We specifically targeted the specialty chemicals industry for investment and we're excited about this transaction as we believe SiVance represents an excellent platform for growth both organically and through acquisition," said Art Harper, a GenNx360 founding partner. "With Craig Stafford as CEO, the strong management team currently in place, and capital support from GenNx360, SiVance is well positioned to leverage its current position in the marketplace as a leading developer of specialty silicone-based products."

Including SiVance, GenNx360 has completed four industry platform investments in each of the following sectors; specialty chemicals, precision machining, asset light logistics and business process outsourcing. In addition, SiVance represents the third transaction completed by GenNx360 in 2009.
