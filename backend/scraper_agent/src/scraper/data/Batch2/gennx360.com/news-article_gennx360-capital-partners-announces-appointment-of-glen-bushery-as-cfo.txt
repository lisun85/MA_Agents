GenNx360 Capital Partners, a leading New York-based private equity firm that invests in middle market industrial manufacturing and business services companies, announced today the appointment of industry veteran, Glen Bushery, CPA, as Chief Financial Officer effective immediately.

Prior to his private accounting experience, Glen held public accounting positions at both Raich Ende Malter Lerner & Co. and Horne Nadler & Co., both in New York.
 
“We are extremely pleased to welcome Glen to the GenNx360 executive team," said Lloyd Trotter, a Founder and Managing Partner at GenNx360.  “He brings a wealth of financial and organizational experience and a strong background in private equity finance, which will provide significant benefits as we look to take our firm to the next level.”
 
“I am excited for the opportunity to work with GenNx360 and its talented team of global operators and investment professionals,” Glen said. “I’m here to help build the infrastructure needed to facilitate continued growth and value creation.”
