Portfolio Company News - November 25, 2024
NEW YORK, NY – November 22, 2024 – GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), a New York-based private equity firm, is pleased to announce the final sale of its portfolio company, ITsavvy LLC (“ITsavvy” or “the Company”), a provider of end-to-end IT infrastructure solutions, to Xerox Holdings Corporation (“Xerox”) for $400 million. This transaction marks a significant milestone for GenNx360, as its first investment in the technology services sector.
 
ITsavvy is an Oak Brook, Illinois-based technology solutions and services provider that delivers frictionless IT experiences by designing, developing and delivering technology infrastructure solutions and services that accelerate business outcomes on behalf of its clients.
 
During GenNx360’s investment, the Company experienced impressive organic growth, completed an acquisition of a highly strategic AIOps-enabled managed services provider (“MSP”) and significantly increased overall profitability through several well-executed margin enhancement initiatives. A committed focus to the Company’s services strategy further fueled organic growth and strengthened the Company’s overall value proposition. Through the support of GenNx360, the Company also successfully launched an AI and Intelligent Automation strategy. This strategy included commercializing an AI offering to better serve the Company’s clients, as well as optimizing the Company’s internal operations.
 
"The completion of this transaction marks a significant milestone for ITsavvy and for GenNx360. Over the past two years, ITsavvy has undergone exceptional growth and transformation under the leadership of Munu Gandhi and his team. Their dedication and collaboration with our firm have been critical to the company’s success. We are proud of ITsavvy’s achievements and confident it will continue to thrive as part of Xerox,” said Ron Blaylock, GenNx360 Founder and Managing Partner, and Chairman of the ITsavvy Board of Directors.
 
“We appreciate GenNx360’s support and strategic insights over the past two years. They have been an outstanding partner to work with to enhance and evolve our platform,” said ITsavvy CEO, Munu Gandhi. “We are excited to join forces with a longstanding company in Xerox, one of the great global brands, and we look forward to supporting their next stage of growth.”
 
"As part of our Reinvention, we have created a greater organizational focus on our emerging IT Services capabilities," said John Bruno, President and Chief Operating Officer at Xerox. “ITsavvy’s complementary offerings, combined with our reputation, position us to accelerate growth across key markets and unlock new opportunities to help clients transform the way they work."
 
“It has been a privilege to work with Munu and the ITsavvy team over the past two years. We are incredibly proud of the Company’s growth and look forward to following their success in the future,” said Peter White, Principal at GenNx360 and ITsavvy Board Member.
