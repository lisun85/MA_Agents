GenNx360 Capital Partners Supports Tooling Technology Holdings’ Acquisition of Majestic Industries Inc.
Portfolio Company News - May 27, 2015

New York, New York:  Tooling Technology Holdings, LLC ("Tooling Tech"), a portfolio company of GenNx360 Capital Partners (“GenNx360”), acquired Majestic Industries Inc. (“Majestic”), a Macomb, Michigan, based manufacturer of progressive and transfer dies, on May 22, 2015.
 
The Majestic acquisition adds significant benefits and expertise to Tooling Tech, expanding tooling capabilities that now include: compression molding, progressive dies, transfer dies, thermoforming, blow molding and rotational molding. This broad range of capabilities allows the group to continue expanding into a number of different industries ranging from automotive to industrial and positions the Company to offer numerous solutions to service the needs of its customers as a one-stop tooling shop.
 
“Majestic is a great fit for us as it adds progressive die tooling capabilities to our offerings, expands our customer base and provides us with improved visibility in the supply chain,” says Tony Seger, CEO of Tooling Tech. “This merger enhances our offerings through the addition of design capabilities, low volume production, and repair services,” he added.
 
“After more than 45 years of ownership and pursuant to our strategy to identify a new owner, we are delighted that Tooling Tech, together with GenNx360, is acquiring Majestic. Tooling Tech has the capital and management expertise to take Majestic to the next level,” said Al Janiszewski, Majestic’s founder.
 
"This acquisition vertically integrates the GenNx360 automotive tooling platform, expanding product diversity to the current offerings. Majestic’s strong engineering team and its well-entrenched OEM relationships will enable the platform to extend its footprint and market presence," said Matthew Guenther, the GenNx360 Partner who led the transaction.
