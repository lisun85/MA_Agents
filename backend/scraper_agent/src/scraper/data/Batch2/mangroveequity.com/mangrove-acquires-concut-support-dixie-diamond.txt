Establishes a strong presence in the pacific northwest, west coast, and rocky mountain regions to complement Dixie Diamond’s dominance in the eastern U.S.
Affords Dixie and Concut the ability to better serve our customers through fulfillment of orders from either our west coast or east coast facilities
Revenue synergies through product cross-selling opportunities
Provides entry into the new end market of products for the grinding and grooving of concrete
