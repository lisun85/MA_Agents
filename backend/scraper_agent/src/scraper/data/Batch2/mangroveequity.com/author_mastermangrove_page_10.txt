Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the $125MM closing of MEP II

Posted September 30th, 2013 by Mangrove Equity Partners & filed under Portfolio News.

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the first and final closing of our latest fund, MEP II.  Our formal fund raising process for this $125MM equity fund was quick, requiring only a few months to complete. Virtually all of our existing limited partners invested in MEP II. Due to our good fortune in MEP I, we enjoyed the reward of there being significantly more interest in the fund than there was room.
