Mangrove Announces Sale of Shields Business Solutions

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the sale of Shields Business Solutions, a leading provider of bank technology solutions primarily focused on the sale, installation and maintenance of ATMs and ITMs. Headquartered in Moorestown, NJ, Shields also provides cash-in-transit services, offering its bank and credit union customers a unique single-source solution.

Shields and Mangrove were an uncommonly strong fit as Shields’ management team was seeking a partner with the operational resources and industry experience to help them pursue an ambitious growth strategy. “Our partnership with Mangrove was tremendously valuable to Shields. They worked closely with us to set a clear strategic vision and then supported our execution with their experience and significant investments in people, systems and infrastructure. I’m thankful to the Mangrove team for their commitment and support and the success we achieved together,” said Mark McGrath, President of Shields of Business Solutions.

Mangrove proved to be materially helpful while supporting the Shields team on a number of strategic initiatives. Together, we:

Updated and bolstered Shields’ organizational structure so that President Mark McGrath had more senior management support, fewer direct reports and significantly more time to focus on strategy and value creation
Recruited and hired an experienced sales leader and a Chief Financial Officer
Implemented a customized ERP system that specifically addressed the operational requirements and service level demands of both the ATM maintenance and cash-in-transit business segments
Maximized sales opportunity from industry trends to sell new hardware and grow long-term maintenance contracts
Consistently outperformed competition to win armored service contracts from larger competitors based on Shields’ industry-leading service levels
