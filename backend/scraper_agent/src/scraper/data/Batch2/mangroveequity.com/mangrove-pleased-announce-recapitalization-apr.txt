Mangrove is Pleased to Announce the Recapitalization of APR

Mangrove recently partnered with the management team of APR to effect a majority recapitalization of this leading producer of software and hardware systems to boost the performance of Volkswagen Auto Group (VAG) cars. APR makes performance products for Audi, Volkswagen, SEAT, Skoda and Porsche.

Mangrove was attracted to APR because of its niche-dominant position, its talented team, and APR’s history of creating quality-leading performance enhancing tuning products. The Mangrove team has enjoyed considerable successes in the auto aftermarket and with other enthusiast-driven consumer product companies, and we are excited to continue that success with APR.

Mangrove’s internal operating team will work collaboratively with the folks at APR to optimize operating efficiency, profitability, and growth, while preserving APR’s outstanding commitment to quality and the satisfaction of its customers.
