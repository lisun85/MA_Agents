Mangrove is pleased to announce the sale of Gayesco, LLC

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the sale of Gayesco, LLC. With the exit of Gayesco, Mangrove has enjoyed yet another successful partnership with a strong management team seeking the ideal partner for liquidity and growth. The ability of Mangrove’s three-man internal operating team to help management build value was evident at Gayesco where Mangrove supported management in:

Building an international sales organization
Developing a robust service offering to compliment core engineering and manufacturing activities
Transitioning the business from an entrepreneurial organization to an optimized enterprise
Instituting a strategic planning process to bring focus on the vital few optimization opportunities with maximum impact

Mangrove believes that people and culture are the most important part of our portfolio companies’ success. Since culture starts from the top down, we believe in taking good care of our management teams before, during and after our partnership with them. Mangrove went beyond contractual obligations and provided management with transaction bonuses from our own proceeds, and accelerated the vesting of meaningful options.

Gayesco, LLC is a Houston, TX based manufacturer of high-quality, custom–engineered, precise temperature measurement systems for process plants where ultra-precise temperature measurement is critical to ensure process efficiency, product quality and safety.  Gayesco’s proprietary, innovative systems enjoy material competitive advantages relative to competitors’ systems.

Mangrove Equity Partners: More Than the Commodity of Cash. The Mangrove team works hard to be your go-to private equity fund in the lower middle market by leveraging our extensive experience (126 deals across 53 industries) to make decisions and get deals done. Mangrove’s three-man internal operating team affords us an ability to relate to entrepreneurs through shared experience, and credibility.

Mangrove has exemplified an attitude and practice of partnership with our deal sources over the past 24 years. We roll up our sleeves and work with intermediaries to do what is necessary to move good deals forward. If an opportunity is not a fit for Mangrove’s criteria, we endeavor to provide accurate and helpful suggestions as to who may have a pointed interest. Our goal is to help our deal sources get their deals done and accordingly, become their go-to fund in the lower middle market. We hope to have the pleasure of working closely with you.
