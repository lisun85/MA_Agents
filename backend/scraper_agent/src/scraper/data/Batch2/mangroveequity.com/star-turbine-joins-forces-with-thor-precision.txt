STAR Turbine Joins Forces with Thor Precision

STAR Turbine, Inc. (“STAR”), a leading manufacturer of custom turbine parts, is pleased to announce that it has joined forces with Thor Precision, LLC (“Thor”), a precision manufacturer of high-quality aftermarket parts for industrial gas turbines.

Founded in 2009 by industry veterans Paul and Andy Pelinsky, Thor operates out of a state-of-the-art, purpose-built facility in Greenville, South Carolina. Thor’s core product line consists of roll threaded rotating engine hardware for modern and legacy industrial gas turbines. These parts, ranging up to 140” in length, are critical wear components that maintain proper support, spacing, and balance for rotating bladed wheels inside gas turbines. Thor’s team has extensive knowledge and experience producing tight tolerance turbine parts from a variety of nickel-based superalloys and stainless steel.

Bringing STAR and Thor together is the latest step in Mangrove Equity Partners’ (“Mangrove”) efforts to build a family of leading parts manufacturers serving the gas and steam turbine aftermarket.

Andy Pelinsky has been promoted to President of Thor and remains an equity owner in the business alongside Mangrove and members of the STAR team. “We are excited to partner with STAR and Mangrove,” said Andy. “When my father Paul and I started Thor over 14 years ago, we emphasized a culture of family values, safety, product quality, and operational excellence. Having multiple paths to choose from, it was obvious that STAR and Mangrove were the best partners and cultural and operational fit for Thor.”

Donna Rambin, STAR’s Vice President of Sales and a long-time industry veteran, shared Andy’s excitement, “We are thrilled to partner with Andy and the Thor team. Like STAR, the folks at Thor have developed a truly special culture and always put their customers first. It’s a great fit and together we will offer a broader set of high quality aftermarket turbine parts to all of our customers and leverage our combined capabilities to expand that offering even further.”

Mangrove and STAR are currently seeking to invest in additional turbine parts manufacturing businesses with revenues from $5 million to $50 million. Inquiries can be directed to Matt Kane, Director of Sourcing at Mangrove Equity Partners (mkane@mangroveequity.com).
