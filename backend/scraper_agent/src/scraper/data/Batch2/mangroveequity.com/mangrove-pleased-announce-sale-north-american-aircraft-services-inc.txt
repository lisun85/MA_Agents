Mangrove is pleased to announce the sale of North American Aircraft Services, Inc.

Mangrove Equity Partners is pleased to announce the sale of North American Aircraft Services, Inc. (“NAAS”). With the exit of NAAS, Mangrove has enjoyed yet another successful partnership in which the Mangrove team was materially helpful in building significant value for all shareholders. The ability of Mangrove’s three-man internal operating team to help management build value was evident at NAAS where Mangrove supported management in:

Acquiring AOG, our largest competitor, from their Australian parent company
Integrating NAAS/AOG, particularly the two management teams, to optimize company and personal achievement
Acquiring a European competitor to expand into that fertile market and create tax efficiencies
Working extensively with the second-in-command to support his ascent to the President role
Instituting a strategic planning process to bring focus on the vital few optimization opportunities with maximum impact

The results of these efforts was more than doubling the company’s profits.

NAAS is a San Antonio, TX based leading provider of specialized aerospace fuel system maintenance and repair services. NAAS is one of only a few service providers authorized to perform this mission-critical work in a broad array of military and commercial aircraft.
