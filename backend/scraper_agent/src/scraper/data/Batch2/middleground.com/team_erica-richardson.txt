ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ERICA RICHARDSON
Senior Associate, Transaction Team




Erica is a Senior Associate on the Transaction Team. She originally hails from High Point, North Carolina, and attended the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the same alma mater as our founding partner, Lauren. We are sure a strong Tar Heel alliance is already forming! Prior to joining MiddleGround, she worked for Wells Fargo Securities and Harbor View Advisors.

Erica grew up riding horses, which makes her a perfect fit for Kentucky culture. We are certain she will be a regular attendee at Keeneland in no time and have no doubt that she will win big! She once won a motorcycle at a charity raffle when she was in high school, so luck is clearly on her side. Erica is also a proud mother to her fur-son – a goldendoodle named Zeke!
