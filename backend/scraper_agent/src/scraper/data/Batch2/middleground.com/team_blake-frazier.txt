ALL TEAM MEMBERS
BLAKE FRAZIER
Vice President Management Company Accounting, Accounting Team




Blake Frazier is a Vice President on our Operations Team. Blake has a BS in Accounting and Finance from the University of Kentucky and put his CPA certification to use at MCM CPAs & Associates before flexing his finance skills at Alltech, a biotechnology company, as a Finance Manager.

You could write a sitcom about Blake’s home life. Between the chaos of raising a son and attending frequent events for his wife’s horse riding competitions, they also take care of six cats and dogs (our guess is that Blake’s bonus will be spent on a Roomba). When he has the time, he also loves to weight lift and attend baseball games. Private equity has always been Blake’s dream job and we’re ecstatic to have him on the team, so long as he brings his dogs to the office.
