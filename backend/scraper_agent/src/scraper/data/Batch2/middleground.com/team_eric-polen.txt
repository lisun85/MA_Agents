ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ERIC POLEN
Vice President, Operations Team




Eric Polen is a Vice President on our Operations Team and joined us after a decade at the Goodyear Tire Company where he was the Finance Business Partner. He spent his last two years at Goodyear working in the plants each day, priming him perfectly to roll his sleeves up at our portfolio companies. While he’s originally from Ohio and holds his BBA from Ohio University, he’s excited to become a Cats fan!

Much like the rest of the team, he’s a big sports fan; Eric’s claim to fame is that he went to the same high school as Bernie Kosar. During football season, you’re most likely to find Eric glued to the TV and cheering for the Steelers!
