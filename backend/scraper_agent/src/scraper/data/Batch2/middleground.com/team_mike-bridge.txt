ALL TEAM MEMBERS
MIKE BRIDGE
Managing Director, Data Operations




Mike is Managing Director and Head of Data Operations. Prior to MiddleGround, he worked for 18 years with Toyota Motor Corporation. Mike graduated from the University of Louisville with his MBA in Business Administration and Masters in Engineering. The team agrees not to talk about Mike’s alma mater as long as he cheers on the University of Kentucky at team events.

Mike is married with three wonderful children.  He also holds the record for the tallest person in the entire company and came to us with the nickname “2Meters” because he stands 6’7″! Despite his height though, Mike is an easily approachable teammate who is particularly helpful for reaching items on high shelves around the office.
