ALL TEAM MEMBERS
MILES ANDERSON
Vice President, Automation Team




Miles is a Vice President of the Automation Team and like many team members here at MiddleGround, Miles joins us from Toyota where he worked as an Engineer for 8 years after 10 years at Lexmark as a research engineer! Miles graduated from the University of Kentucky with a BS, in Electrical Engineering.

Miles’ twin boys dictate what type of hobbies he currently enjoys. Miles and his boys enjoy fishing, camping, weightlifting, and blade smithing. They picked up making knives after watching Forged in the Fire Episodes – so Miles is definitely someone you’d want to keep around in a survivalist’s situation!
