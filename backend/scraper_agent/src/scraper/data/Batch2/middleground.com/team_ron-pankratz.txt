RON PANKRATZ
Human Capital Vice President, Operations Team




Ron is a Vice President on the Operations Team, supporting human capital needs across our portfolio. Prior to joining MiddleGround, Ron worked as an HR professional in the automotive industry for 20+ years including stints at Toyota (TMMK) and Volkswagen Chattanooga. He earned his Bachelor’s in psychology and Master’s in industrial/organizational psychology from Western Kentucky University.

When Ron isn’t busy supporting our portfolio’s human capital needs, you’ll find him supporting his family and community. He has three children, twin daughters and a son, and he keeps busy between their many hobbies which include video production, soccer, and softball. He also enjoys vintage cars and other hands-on projects.That’s obvious when he talks about the homemade display case he made for all the softballs his daughter has hit out of the park. When the Pankratz family isn’t on the road for family sports you can find them on the lake wakeboarding and water skiing on lake Chickamauga near his home in Chattanooga Tennessee.
