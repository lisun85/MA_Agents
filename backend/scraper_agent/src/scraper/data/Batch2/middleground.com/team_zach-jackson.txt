ZACH JACKSON
Vice President, Operations Team




Zach is a Vice President on the Operations Team. Zach started his career with Mitsubishi before moving to Toyota.  Zach met John, Scot, and Greg while leading the equipment installation for a  model launch at Toyota’s plant in Georgetown, KY. Zach has a Bachelors’s Degree in Robotics and Automation from ITT Technical Institute.

John likes to point out that Zach has forgotten more about manufacturing equipment design and installation than anyone he knows and that is quite the compliment considering the experience of our team.  Zach was born in Kentucky but moved to Ohio when he was a young boy.  Zach fondly remembers how “special” it was to start school in Ohio and be the smartest kid in the room.
