RYAN MCCOMB
Managing Director, Transaction Team




Ryan is a Managing Director on the Transaction Team. Ryan joins us from New Water Capital, where he was an Associate that worked on multiple transactions and portfolio companies across the industrial, automotive and consumer sectors. Prior to joining New Water, Ryan was an investment banker in the Aerospace & Defense group at BB&T Capital Markets in Washington DC. Ryan has a degree in Business Administration with a Concentration in Finance from Southern Methodist University.

Born and raised in Tampa, Ryan is the last true Buccaneers fan. Ryan likes to play golf and spend time on the water with friends. Ryan doubles as a professional Bocce ball player. During the Pandemic quarantine, Ryan took the opportunity to bulk up. His biceps are quite the distraction on a Zoom call and it is not just the camera angle. We are lucky to have Ryan on our team as he was heavily recruited to be on the MTV reality series Siesta Key.
