ALL TEAM MEMBERS
JASON JACOB
Managing Director, Operations Team




Jason is a Managing Director on the Operations Team.  Like many other teammates, he joined us from Toyota where he spent over 21 years.  Jason started as an assistant manager of Engineering and Production. Most recently, Jason was Group manager of Paint & Welding.  He graduated from the University of Kentucky with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering.

Jason has spent most of his free time coaching his daughter’s softball team, but since both have moved out, he has since retired.  We’re hoping we can coax Jason out of retirement to head up a MiddleGround softball team.
