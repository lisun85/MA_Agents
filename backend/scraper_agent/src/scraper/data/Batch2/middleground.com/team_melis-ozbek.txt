MELIS ÖZBEK
Vice President, Operations Team

Amsterdam, NL




Melis is our Vice President of Operations in the Amsterdam Office. Born and raised in Turkey, Melis earned her degree from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. Post-graduation, Melis spent 15 years working for Sensata Technologies, while she stayed at the same company, she lived all over the world in places like Bulgaria, Germany, China, and (luckily for us) the Netherlands! The journey to MiddleGround seemed like serendipity when she decided to settle down in Amsterdam and simultaneously contemplate leaving Sensata.

Melis has always had an affinity for being active; Did you know that she pioneered one of the first beach volleyball teams on the Mediterranean coast? And she was good too! On top of her hand-eye coordination, Melis’ true athletic passion comes through when she is on the dance floor. She’s spent the last 20 years perfecting the art of Latin Ballroom dancing and Argentinian Tango. If you ever need a pair of dancing shoes, Melis has got you covered!
