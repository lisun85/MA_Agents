DANA FRISHMAN
Senior Associate, Transaction Team




Dana is a Senior Associate and joined us from a Private Equity Associate position at Audax Group. Prior to her start in PE, she interned with Fashion Week and at Chateau Valandraud in Saint-Émilion, France (yes, we’re all jealous). Dana obtained a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and in economics from Amherst College.

Dana’s varied and exciting work history mirrors her hobbies! Outside of her incredible travel experiences, visiting prosciutto factories in Italy and sightseeing in places from Singapore to Hong Kong, she likes to spend her time volunteering with mentorship-focused organizations like Big Brother Big Sister, playing competitive card games with her family, wine-tasting, and staying active. Dana was even a competitive long jumper in college but has since decided to pick up longer-distance running (since jumping only requires five seconds of running at a time). If you need help picking a wine (which we do, as frequent consumers of “Two Buck Chucks” from Trader Joe’s), want a partner for any card game under the sun, or someone to go to a baseball game with – Dana is your girl!
