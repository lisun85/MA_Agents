JORDAN GABBERT
Vice President, Investor Relations




Jordan is a Vice President on the Investor Relations Team.  Jordan joined us from Vaco, where she was a Senior Associate responsible for recruiting and business development.  Prior to that, Jordan held various analytical positions for ConAgra Foods, Ralcorp Frozen Bakery, and Parker Hannifin. Jordan graduated from the University of Kentucky and earned undergraduate degrees in Management and Accounting, and has an MBA from Midway University.

Jordan is very organized and likes to have plans for everything. When Jordan got married, she famously said that she “enjoyed planning the wedding much more than the thought of actually being married.” Like all of our employees, Jordan is dedicated to ESG. Jordan’s ESG initiative is volunteering to teach aged professionals how to use modern technology. Like most people in Kentucky, Jordan enjoys watching Kentucky basketball and singing along to country music.
