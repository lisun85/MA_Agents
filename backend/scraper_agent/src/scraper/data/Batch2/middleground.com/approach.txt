SECTOR FOCUS
INDUSTRIALS, MANUFACTURING, AND SPECIALTY DISTRIBUTION

We invest in B2B Industrial businesses in the lower middle market because that is where we have spent our careers, both as operators and investors. This includes manufacturing and specialty distribution business models. We detect lack of fit early on and remove ourselves from those processes to save everyone time, while moving quickly on companies that are well-aligned with our strategy. We stand behind our bids, which builds credibility and trust with sellers and intermediary relationships.

We are often a preferred buyer due to our ability to speak the language of owners and management teams and the business improvement capabilities our Operations Team brings to the table. We also offer transparency and transaction structure flexibility to enable the alignment of all stakeholders toward future equity value creation.

We believe our experience translates to many manufacturing and distribution businesses that serve a variety of different end markets, as outlined below.
