ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ZACH SPENCER
Senior Associate, Transaction Team




Zach is a Senior Associate on our Transaction team. Zach joined us from Wells Fargo.  Zach attended Auburn University where he received a degree in Business Administration.

Zach comes from a family of multiple talents.  Both of his parents have jobs in the medical field but their real passion is bee keeping.  Together with his parents and twin brother, they run a frame spacer metal stamping business for beekeepers called AZ Frame Spacers https://www.azframespacers.com

We are excited to welcome Zach to the team but John is on guard due to his severe allergic reaction to bee stings. Being from Florida, we assume Zach also is an avid surfer and his favorite movie is Point Break.
