Tyler is a Vice President on the Transaction Team. Prior to joining MiddleGround, Tyler held summer positions in the Leveraged Finance group at Wells Fargo as well as at Cambridge Associates. Tyler has a degree in Finance from the University of Kentucky.

Tyler was our very first hire and worked as an underpaid intern while completing his undergraduate degree. Tyler’s first paycheck was from John’s personal account. Tyler’s dream job has always been to work in private equity in Lexington, Kentucky. Since MiddleGround is currently the only private equity firm located in Lexington, he is living the dream. Tyler’s nickname is “Boy Genius”. Tyler enjoys playing golf, although he is 10 strokes better on the simulator than the actual course.
