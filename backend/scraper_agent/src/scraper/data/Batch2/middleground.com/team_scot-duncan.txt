SCOT DUNCAN
Partner, Chief Operating Officer




Scot is one of the founding Partners of MiddleGround where he acts as Chief Operating Officer. Scot is a member of the Investment Committee at MiddleGround Capital. Scot started his career at Toyota Motor Corporation and spent 13 years in assembly engineering, maintenance, and production management. Prior to founding MiddleGround, Scot spent 9 years at the prior firm with John and Lauren, serving as Director of Operations. Scot received a Toyota Fellowship to attend the University of Kentucky where he earned degrees in Mechanical Engineering and a Masters of Engineering in Manufacturing Systems.

Although Scot and his wife, Susan, are empty nesters, they would say they still have two “children” (i.e. dogs) at home. He and his wife enjoy implementing lean manufacturing initiatives throughout their home. Scot made the mistake of singing karaoke in front of John Stewart one night in Japan where he sang “My Cherie Amour” by Stevie Wonder. According to John, this is now the official song of MiddleGround Capital.
