ALL TEAM MEMBERS
JOE LUDWIG
Senior Associate, Transaction Team




Joe is a Senior Associate on the Transaction Team. Joe joins us with over seven years of banking experience, his most recent role was as a Director at Ouabache Investments – a single-family office based in Indiana – but he has also worked at Cooper Run, ComStock Advisors, and JP Morgan. He has his bachelor’s degree in Finance from Xavier University.   

Joe’s experience in private equity is focused on food and agriculture investments because Ouabache was established by the Weaver family which owns Weaver Popcorn, the world’s largest popcorn company. Joe could run a TED talk JUST about popcorn, so don’t get him started unless you want a whiteboard session about the different varieties. Besides popcorn, Joe enjoys trying new steakhouses, going on hiking trips (even completing a huge Grand Canyon hike), playing with his Vizsla puppy Tilly, and deep cleaning every square inch of his home. No, we’re not kidding. He loves cleaning so much, that when he was being potty trained his parents would LET him vacuum for 15 minutes if he used the toilet. Maybe instead of a bonus this year, we’ll just give Joe permission to clean the Lexington office. It’s a win-win!
