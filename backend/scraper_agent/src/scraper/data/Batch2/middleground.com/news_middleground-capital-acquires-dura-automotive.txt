MIDDLEGROUND CAPITAL ACQUIRES DURA AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS

Lexington, KY–August 5, 2020: MiddleGround Capital announced today that it has acquired majority ownership of Dura Automotive Systems from Bardin Hill Investment Partners. This is MiddleGround’s sixth platform acquisition made from its first fund, which closed in August 2019.

Dura supplies leading automotive OEMs and Tier one partners worldwide, with a presence on more than 300 platforms across all light vehicle and powertrain types.

MiddleGround partner John Stewart, who spent 18 years of his career at Toyota Motor Company, stated, “We have been searching for an opportunity to invest in a business as well-positioned as Dura to capitalize on the most disruptive trends in the automotive industry. From today’s focus on electrification of the powertrain and vehicle lightweighting to some of the longer-term shifts toward autonomous driving and connected car, Dura is and will continue to be a driving force in an industry undergoing major transformation. We are delighted to support Dura on its journey.”

“Dura’s engineering capabilities have made it a key supplier to its customer base for many decades. We are excited to further Dura’s legacy of partnering with its customers to develop next generation products of superior quality,” said MiddleGround partner Scot Duncan, who spent 13 years at Toyota Motor Company in assembly engineering, maintenance and production management. “We value the support Dura’s customers have shown over the years and look forward to working together on this next phase of growth.”

We want to thank our customers, suppliers and employees for their unwavering support as we begin our next chapter as a new company.”

Dura CEO Kimberly Rodriguez noted, “I am thrilled to join such a talented organization.
