ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ANTHONY DENAIX
Managing Director, Head of EU Business Development and Investor Relations

Amsterdam, NL




Anthony is the Managing Director and Head of European Business Development in our Amsterdam office. He joined us with a wealth of experience in business development and PE client solutions from his time with Orbit Partners, GLG and Calash Ltd. He holds a MSc from UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate School as well as an Executive Masters in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from HEC Paris.

Anthony grew up in the southwest of France but spent over 10 years living in Ireland and London. Although he is French through and through, people often have a hard time placing his accent and features; he’s won many free beers by betting bar folk that they couldn’t guess his origin! To cement his status as a Frenchman, he has a deep appreciation for wine and forages for mushrooms to cook delicious meals for his wife and daughter, Lucie. He’s promised to give us lessons so we can all impress our partners (though I doubt we can pull it off with the same flair).
