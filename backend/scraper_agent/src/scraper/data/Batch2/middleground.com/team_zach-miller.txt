ALL TEAM MEMBERS
ZACH MILLER
Vice President, Human Capital




Zach Miller is the VP of our Human Capital team and joins our growing list of University of Kentucky alumni! Zach obtained his degree from UK before moving back to his hometown of Findlay, OH to begin working at a recruiting firm which was ultimately acquired by ADP. He spent 10 years with ADP in their client relations teams before moving to in-house talent acquisition in 2019, he joined us from an agriculture start-up called AppHarvest where he acted as a Manager of Talent Acquisition.

The recruiting world in Lexington is small, and Zach is proof of it. When he was recruited to join MiddleGround, he received a LinkedIn message from Shelby Hundley… and noticed he was already connected with her! Funnily enough, he’d tried to recruit her previously, and so, the recruiter becomes the recruited. Despite being born in Ohio, Zach prefers the culture and food of the South. He enjoys trying new southern recipes, and is a self-proclaimed (mediocre) pit master, with his brisket and chili being his claim to culinary fame (tip: stay away from his cakes, he’s known to swap sugar and salt!). Zach also loves to travel with his wife Chelsea and their dog Odin; with Oktoberfest in Munich at the top of his list, but before he goes, make sure he pops a Zyrtec… his allergies are no joke.
