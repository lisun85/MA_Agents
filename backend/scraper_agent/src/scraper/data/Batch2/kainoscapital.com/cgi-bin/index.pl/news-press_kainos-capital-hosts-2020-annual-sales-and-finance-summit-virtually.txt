Kainos Capital Hosts 2020 Annual Sales and Finance Summit, Virtually
September 1, 2020

Dallas, TX – Last month, Kainos Capital held its 2020 Kainos Annual Sales and Finance Summits in a virtual meeting format with leaders from the Kainos portfolio companies and members of the Kainos team. Despite the obvious challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic, the Kainos team remains very active in driving value across the portfolio in partnership with the portfolio company leadership teams. Kainos believes these summits are critical in sharing best practices and further enable us to build strong networks across our portfolio. Moreover, as retailers and distributors navigate these unprecedented times, it is increasingly important for our portfolio companies to understand the concerns and challenges of our partners, which allows for deeper partnerships and stronger execution.

The summits included a combined session led by a panel of merchandising and financial retail leaders from national mass, C-store, grocery and food service corporations, sharing their thoughts on the state of the industry in the pandemic environment and resulting changes in consumer behavior. The Sales leaders focused on critical topics such as digital marketing, sales planning and product analysis best practices, and the Finance leaders dove into functional topics including ESG, cyber-security, and new technical accounting standards, and also shared the results of a Kainos COVID19 preparedness plans to benchmark best practices.

Kevin Elliott, Partner at Kainos Capital, said, “Operational excellence is a critical part of our investment strategy, and we believe these summits are integral to the effectiveness of the Kainos portfolio leadership teams as they navigate through COVID19 and beyond. Our sector has further revealed many pockets of opportunity, even amidst a global pandemic, by leveraging the vast knowledge of our portfolio company leaders and industry relationships.”

“This connection point with other leaders in our industry certainly makes good2grow better at what we do each day, and during challenging and uncertain times, we appreciate the energy and camaraderie with the broader group.”

Gunnar Olson, CEO of Kainos portfolio company good2grow, said “I have participated in several of these summits with Kainos, and this year was given the opportunity not only to learn from other industry leaders and my peers but also to share knowledge from good2grow’s experience. This connection point with other leaders in our industry certainly makes good2grow better at what we do each day, and during challenging and uncertain times, we appreciate the energy and camaraderie with the broader group.”
