Kainos Capital Closes $895 Million Fund II
October 31, 2016

Dallas, TX — Kainos Capital LP, a Texas-based investment firm with an exclusive focus on the food and consumer sector, today announced the closing of Kainos Capital Partners II (“Fund II”) with total equity commitments of $895 million. Fund II was oversubscribed and closed at its hard cap. Fund II follows Kainos’ inaugural Fund I, which closed in 2013 with $475 million of committed capital. 

Andrew Rosen, Managing Partner of Kainos Capital, said, “We are very proud of the enthusiastic response to our second fund and the confidence placed in us by our limited partners. This new fund will enable us to broaden the size of transactions that we pursue and give us even more resources to drive growth and profitability in companies through organizational development, customer and channel expansion, new product innovation, effective marketing programs, and operational improvement. We look forward to working with the management teams of privately held founder, family and corporate-owned businesses to deploy this fund.”
