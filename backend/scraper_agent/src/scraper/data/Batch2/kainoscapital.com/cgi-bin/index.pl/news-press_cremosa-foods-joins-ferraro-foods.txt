Cremosa Foods Joins Ferraro Foods
January 28, 2021

Company History
Industry veteran Joe Murgolo, an executive at both Polly-O and Friendship Dairies, purchased Cremosa Food Company and New Cremflora Foods in 1995. One year later he was joined by John Albanese, who stepped in as President of both locations. Together, they optimized Cremosa’s product offerings and expanded their line of exclusive brands. Today, their inventory includes a fully supplied stock of over 5,000 items, ranging from fresh, refrigerated and frozen food products to restaurant equipment and supplies. With their large selection of products, they are able to service an array of eateries from pizzeria’s to high-end supermarkets and Italian restaurants. Their fleet of refrigerated and frozen trucks are operated out of Melville, New York and Ocala, Florida.

Exclusive Brands
In order to better cater to the independent pizzeria John and Joe wanted to create an exclusive brand of mozzarella cheese that would be able to stand up against the large name brands. With both of their backgrounds being in dairy, they set out to develop a high end, high quality mozzarella. Wisconsin certified “Master Cheese Makers” developed Finalmente Mozzarella in the milk rich area of Wisconsin cheese country. Finalmente Mozzarella quickly became a favorite among pizza makers for its rich buttery flavor, stretch and mouthfeel.

The Finalmente brand quickly expanded into other premium quality ingredients such as meatballs, grated cheese and flour. Finalmente is not the only quality exclusive brand that Cremosa offers. Asti is the leader in high quality jarred Italian items such as peppers and artichokes. In addition, their longest standing exclusive brand, the Cremosa branded line of products.

Acquisition Outlook
John is excited to join the Ferraro Foods family and is looking forward to working more closely with Michael Giammarino, CEO of Ferraro Foods and Thomas Recine, President & COO of Ferraro Foods. This partnership gives Cremosa Food Company and New Cremflora the opportunity to expand their reach and better support their customers along the East Coast. The acquisition of Cremosa Food Company will help to strengthen and unify legacy family brands on Long Island. Combined with the recent M&A of C&F Foods and LaRosa Food Distributors the completion of this most recent acquisition will join the three strongest pizza distributors on Long Island.
