December 9, 2020

 

Builds on Kainos’ Strong History in the Health and Wellness Space
Supported by Structured Investment from MSD Partners

 

Dallas, TX — Kainos Capital, a private equity firm specializing in acquiring and managing food and consumer businesses, has completed its previously announced acquisition of Nutrisystem, the preeminent direct-to-consumer nutrition and weight management brand, from Tivity Health (Nasdaq: TVTY) for $575 million. The Private Capital Group of MSD Partners, L.P. has partnered with Kainos Capital in this transaction in the form of a preferred and common equity investment.

The transaction reestablishes Nutrisystem as an independent company that will build on its more than 45-year history of helping millions of consumers manage their health through a balanced and clinically proven approach to weight loss.

Andrew Rosen, Managing Partner of Kainos, said, “We are excited to add Nutrisystem to the Kainos portfolio of companies. The Nutrisystem platform provides accessible and convenient weight management products and tools that enable consumers across the nation to achieve their healthier lifestyle goals. This opportunity is particularly attractive during the pandemic when health and wellness is top of mind and it is more challenging for many people to access affordable, healthy meals.”

“The investment in Nutrisystem builds on the Kainos team’s strong history in the health and wellness space, including SlimFast, which we established as one of the fastest-growing brands in the weight management category under our ownership.”
