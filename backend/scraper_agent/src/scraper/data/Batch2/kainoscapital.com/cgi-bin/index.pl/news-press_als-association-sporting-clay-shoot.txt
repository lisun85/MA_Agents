ALS Association Sporting Clay Shoot
March 6, 2020

Dallas, TX â€“ This spring, the ALS Association of Texas held its first local fundraising event of the year, Shoot Out ALS, a sporting clay shooting competition benefiting the ALS Association. The inaugural event raised nearly $50,000. Kainos Capital was a very generous sponsor of the event, and several members of the Kainos team participated in the competition. The ALS Association is the only national non-profit organization completely dedicated to fighting ALS, which is a progressive neuro degenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years of diagnosis.
