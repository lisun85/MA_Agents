Overview


Partnership Value


For Business Owners

Harren Equity Partners is a private equity firm dedicated to the growth and development of industry-leading companies through the creation of strong partnerships. Harren's strategy is to create long-term value by improving operational performance, providing in-depth strategic analysis, and executing a plan in partnership with portfolio company executives. Harren professionals take time to learn the business from the beginning of our investment process, develop and implement a strategic business plan, and support management with the increasingly complicated decisions associated with growing a business.

The Harren investment philosophy is based on four primary pillars:

Provide management the resources necessary to support controlled and steady growth
Work together to manage each business discipline to a world-class level
Create a simple equity structure to align management’s interests with Harren’s
Maintain an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust, integrity, and discretion
