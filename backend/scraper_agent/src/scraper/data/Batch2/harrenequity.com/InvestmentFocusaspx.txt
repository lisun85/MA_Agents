"When I first met the folks from Harren, I recall being impressed by their emphasis on complete alignment with me and our AGI team. My management group and our partners at Harren have an identical form of ownership which means risks and rewards are exactly the same. That alliance allows each decision to be made from the perspective of increasing shareholder value."
