WE ARE GRAYLIGHT
About Us
Graylight Partners provides capital and support to emerging middle-market companies for the purpose of creating long-term value. We are approachable and collaborative investment partners with a different perspective. Our goal is to achieve growth through business model refinement and sustainable value creation, not financial engineering.
 
As such, we seek out opportunities in unique business niches to find companies that are doing things differently. We look for innovators and groundbreakers that need a true partner to take their business to the next level.

We then work closely with these teams, bringing extensive operational expertise and a network of resources and support to the table. We provide capital to generate liquidity, facilitate generational change, accelerate growth, enhance capabilities and improve the companies’ market position.

Join us in transforming the business of private equity through our unique partnership.





We work closely with existing management teams respecting the foundation they’ve built, while offering fresh perspectives on future growth opportunities.

Approach
Our strategy hinges on our belief in trusted partnerships. Value creation for all stakeholders comes from meaningful collaboration and long term relationships. As such, on going open communication and mutual success is critical to us.


We focus on:

VALUE CREATION, NOT FINANCIAL ENGINEERING

We believe that greater gains are made, and long-term value creation is achieved through strategic development of the business model. With small to mid-sized companies, management teams and their resources are often stretched thin, to the detriment of new revenue opportunities and operational efficiencies. We work to properly capitalize the business and put the right resources and infrastructure in place for growth.


STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH MANAGEMENT

Our primary role is to be an approachable advisor and trusted consultant to the management team. We look to this team to run the day-to-day operations ofthe business, and to execute on our shared goals and objectives. We respect the division of responsibilities between investor and management, as well as the need for open communication.


ACTIVE SUPPORT

We believe in active collaboration, providing support beyond financial resources in order to develop a unique competitive advantage. We provide access to an extensive network of long-term relationships and contacts, and also bring our own strengths and experience to implement strategic initiatives in the areas of business development, sales and marketing, operational improvement, acquisitions, corporate finance.



MUTUAL SUCCESS

We target investments in companies who aspire to achieve superior results. We work in close partnership with a company's management team to implement a shared strategic plan to improve earnings and increase equity value. We value significant ownership as a component of management compensation.
