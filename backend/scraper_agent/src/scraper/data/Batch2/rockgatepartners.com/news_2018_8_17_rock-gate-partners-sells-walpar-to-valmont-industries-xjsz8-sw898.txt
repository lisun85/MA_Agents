================================================================================
Rock Gate Partners, LLC (“RGP”) has formed Whitewater Brands, LLC to facilitate the acquisition of Collision Services, Inc. and I.D.E.A., Inc. in partnership with management and Peninsula Capital Partners, L.L.C.

Whitewater Brands, based in Boise, Idaho, is one of the nation’s largest manufacturers, marketers and distributors of essential supplies and equipment to the automotive collision and mechanical repair industries.  Collision Services and I.D.E.A. each serve as one-stop sources for administrative supplies, marketing materials and specialized equipment necessary to run a collision repair or mechanical repair shop.  Collision Services and I.D.E.A. differentiate their product offering relative to pure marketers and distributors through offering proprietary products specifically designed for the automotive collision and mechanical repair industries.

In addition to its market leading automotive aftermarket brands, Whitewater Brands also owns Sole Source which provides marketing and administrative materials to the veterinary, construction and trucking industries.

Rock Gate Partners intends to expand Whitewater’s businesses organically and through add-on acquisitions of unique business-to-business marketing companies.
