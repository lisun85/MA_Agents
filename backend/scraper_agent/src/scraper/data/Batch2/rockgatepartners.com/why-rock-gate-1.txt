TITLE: Why Rock Gate — Rock Gate Partners Website

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
Rock Gate Partners is a Chicago-based private equity firm focused on growing, lower middle market companies exhibiting customer mind share leadership in niche markets.

We are not under pressure to ‘put money to work’ or generate short-term gains. We don’t manage investment horizons based on fund cycles. We invest the capital of our principals, advisors and high net worth partners, with the objective of building market leaders with sustainable, long-term competitive advantages.   

We are a good fit for owners and management teams concerned about the management practices of traditional private equity firms. We offer long-term stability, while affording liquidity options to executives and shareholders that desire to monetize their investment on a horizon that is different from ours.

"The team at Sid Savage loves the partnership with Rock Gate.  My brother and I sold a majority interest in our company to Rock Gate’s Whitewater Brands while participating in the equity going forward.   We chose Rock Gate because of their successful history of partnering with family-owned businesses.  We are tremendously impressed with our bright, hard-working partners' knowledge, guidance and leadership.  Rock Gate’s involvement accelerating growth is invaluable as we build a platform to expand all of the businesses under the Whitewater Brands umbrella.  It’s great to work with a committed team that is honest and delivers on their promises to employees as well as to investors."
