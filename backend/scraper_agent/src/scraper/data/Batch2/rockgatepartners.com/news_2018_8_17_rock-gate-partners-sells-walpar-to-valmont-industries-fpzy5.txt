================================================================================
Chicago, IL, August 9, 2018 – Rock Gate Partners (“Rock Gate”), a Chicago-based private investment firm, and its partners have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Walpar, LLC (“Walpar” or the “Company”) to Valmont Industries, Inc. (NYSE: VMI, “Valmont”), a leading global provider of engineered products and services for infrastructure development and irrigation equipment and services for agriculture. Rock Gate recapitalized Walpar in July 2009 in partnership with Peninsula Capital Partners.

Walpar designs, engineers and fabricates complex overhead sign structures including truss, cantilever and gantry structures primarily for highway applications. During the period of Rock Gate’s and Peninsula’s ownership, the Company significantly expanded its operating footprint, revenue base and profitability through a combination of market-leading quality and customer service, design-build engineering leadership, the expansion of fabrication throughput and consistent process improvement and execution across all aspects of the business.

“The progress and success realized at Walpar over the years has been nothing short of remarkable. We don’t believe that we could have found a better partner for the Walpar team as the Company enters its next phase of growth under Valmont’s leadership.”
