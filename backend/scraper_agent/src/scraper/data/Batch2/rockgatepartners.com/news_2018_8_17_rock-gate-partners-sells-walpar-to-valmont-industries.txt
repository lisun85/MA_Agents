================================================================================
Rock Gate Partners, LLC (“RGP”) announced the recapitalization of Walpar, Inc. in partnership with Peninsula Capital Partners, L.L.C. and the Parker family (Walpar’s founder and controlling shareholders).

Walpar, LLC, based in Birmingham, Alabama, is a leading designer and fabricator of highway signage structures and other highly-engineered, large scale fabricated metal structures.  Walpar has successfully leveraged its superior reputation into significant growth and an industry leadership position, and is well positioned to be a beneficiary of the increased focus on infrastructure investment in the United States.

RGP and management seek to expand Walpar organically and through select add-on acquisitions of complementary infrastructure-oriented companies.

“The Parker family and the entire team at Walpar has built an exceptional business.  We couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity to work with such a talented team that is so passionate about the business that they have created.  We look forward to collaborating with Walpar to further capitalize on its well-deserved market leadership position,” stated Kenneth Ali, RGP Principal & Managing Director.
