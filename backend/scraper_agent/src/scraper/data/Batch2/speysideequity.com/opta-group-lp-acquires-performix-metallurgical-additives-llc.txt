Acquisition expands Opta’s performance materials and specialty chemicals platform.

Opta Group LP (“Opta”), a portfolio company of Speyside Equity Advisers (“Speyside”), announces the acquisition of Performix Metallurgical Additives, LLC (“Performix”) effective April 1, 2024.

Performix supplies metallurgical additives to the steel and foundry industries, including briquettes, slag conditioners, insulators, and tundish fluxes. Strategically located in Warren, Ohio, and East Chicago, Indiana, Performix’s plants serve its end markets efficiently.

Eric Wiklendt, Opta’s board chairman, says, “Performix is another excellent acquisition for Opta and the Speyside Equity Opportunity Fund. Performix extends Opta’s performance materials and specialty chemicals platform.”

“Performix’s operational facilities and diverse product offerings create a compelling strategic fit for Opta, broadening our molten solutions portfolio and strengthening our supply chain resilience,” explains Mike Ball, Opta’s chief operating officer. “These enhanced capabilities allow Opta to better serve its customers by ensuring a wider range of solutions, improved production capacity, and more reliable delivery.”

Wiklendt adds, “Opta is not a producer of steel, aluminum, copper, foundry castings, concrete, or paper products. Opta is a provider of solutions that make those products better.”
