Acquisition adds specialty manufacturing capacity and increases business opportunities.

Opta Group LLC, a portfolio company of Speyside Equity, announced today that it acquired Metcan Industrial Corporation and its group of manufacturing operations on November 1, 2021.

Since its incorporation nearly 30 years ago, Metcan Industrial Corp. has established itself as a recognized leader by using state-of-the-art technologies to produce and distribute high- quality, custom-blended synthetic slag for use by steelmakers.

“We like this business because Metcan has a culture very similar to ours,” says John Dietrich, CEO of Opta Group. “And, like Opta, Metcan focuses on producing highly engineered synthetic formulations. The added manufacturing capacity gives us room to pursue more business opportunities.”
