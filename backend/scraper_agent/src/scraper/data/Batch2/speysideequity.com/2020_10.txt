Affival and Pennsylvania Partner to Retain Jobs
Company News

Affival Inc., part of Opta Group LLC, has found a new home. And by moving its manufacturing jobs from Plum, Pennsylvania, to nearby New Kensington, the company retained all 50 of its employees.

Affival produces cored-wire products used to alter the properties of steel. In need of new space, the company received interest from several other regions, including Indiana, Kentucky, and Mexico. Working with Pennsylvania officials, Affival completed a $6 million project to relocate its operations to a 145,000-square-foot building in the Advanced Manufacturing Park.

This is a good investment for us. It’s an opportunity to continue to grow in the area.
