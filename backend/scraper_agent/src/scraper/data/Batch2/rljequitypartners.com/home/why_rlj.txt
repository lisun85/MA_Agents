Why RLJ?
Unique Executive-Level Access Across Industries

RLJ Equity was founded by Robert L. Johnson, one of the most influential entrepreneurs in U.S. history. He is the Chairman of RLJ Companies, a diversified holding company with interests in Media and Entertainment, Hospitality, Real Estate, Auto and Financial Services. RLJ leverages Mr. Johnson’s access to key decision-makers in many industries both domestically and internationally, on behalf of our portfolio companies

Experienced Investment Team

RLJ’s core senior investment team has close to 100 years of private equity experience. In addition, the team has invested over $1.0 billion in more than 50 transactions at RLJ and other firms and have significant experience in our preferred industries of: Business Services, Industrial Services, and Value-added Manufacturing

MBE Designation

Another differentiator at RLJ is the ability to certify any of our portfolio companies as a Minority Business Enterprise. If you work with Fortune 1000 companies, this can be a huge benefit as large enterprises usually have supplier diversity initiatives. We collaborate with management to determine if the MBE designation makes strategic sense for the business
