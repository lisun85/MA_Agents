BETHESDA, MD// APRIL 25, 2014// RLJ Equity Partners, LLC and Naylor, LLC, today announced the acquisition of Boxwood Technology, the leading provider of online career centers and careerrelated services to more than 1,000 major associations throughout the United States.

Founded in 1998 by current Chairman and CEO John Bell, Boxwood’s industry-leading technology platform includes career centers, career development, online learning, online and in-person career fairs, mentoring, resume writing, and a newly introduced executive recruitment concierge. To date, Boxwood has helped associations generate over $400 million in non-dues revenue and is the only career center solutions provider to earn an endorsement by the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE), consecutively since 2002.

“RLJ Equity Partners is delighted to support Naylor’s acquisition of Boxwood Technology,” said Jerry L. Johnson, Managing Director of RLJ Equity Partners. “The acquisition of Boxwood further diversifies Naylor’s digital footprint and its product offering to the North American association marketplace.” "We are thrilled to add John Bell and the Boxwood team and products to the Naylor family,” said Alex DeBarr, Naylor President and CEO.

“We firmly believe every association should play a role in the career opportunities and development of its members, and no one does that better than Boxwood. Their products and services are an excellent fit to our full suite of digital, print and event media services and our focus on generating non-dues revenue.”

“This is a great addition to the services we provide our associations,” added DeBarr. “Boxwood will give us a combined total of over 1,400 separate association relationships, and with that a great team that has strong sales, customer service and technology capability that is very complimentary to ours.”

“We are excited to join Naylor and look forward to finding more ways in which we can serve the unique needs of associations,” said John Bell, Chairman and CEO of Boxwood. “There are many ways in which we can collaborate with Naylor to develop creative and unique solutions for associations of all kinds. We are anxious to get started.”

Current plans call for Boxwood to continue operating from its Hunt Valley, MD and Herndon, VA offices. Naylor will continue to offer its full suite of digital, print, event and marketing services from its Gainesville, FL; Atlanta, GA; Fairfax, VA; Darien, CT; and Winnipeg, Canada locations.
