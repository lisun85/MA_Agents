Gainesville, Fla. (August 7, 2014) – Naylor, LLC, which recently acquired association career solutions provider Boxwood Technology, today launched a new brand platform which better reflects the broader “Associations Solutions” and integrated offerings Naylor has launched and acquired over the last three years and provides to 1,500 associations in North America.

Naylor will now go by the name Naylor Association Solutions, which will be depicted in a new logo (see above) and an entirely new branding platform.

“This is an exciting step for Naylor, “said Alex DeBarr, CEO of Naylor since 2006. “The new brand and logo are really a culmination of great work by our teams, the acquisition of Global Exchange Events and recently Boxwood, and our partnership with RLJ Equity Partners. It signals a new phase in the growth and development of our ability to help our associations succeed and build relevance.”

Naylor, founded over 40 years ago in Canada, has been a leader in providing Print media and non-dues revenue solutions for many years. In the last five years the Company has created an equally significant digital media offering, has acquired event management capability (via Convention Management Group in 2007) and a thriving exchange event business (via Global Exchange Events in 2012) as well as the Boxwood career product line. Naylor now has over 20 distinct product offerings which it customizes for associations offerings.

During this period, Naylor has also launched Association TV & Video, Content Strategy and Member Research offerings, and has added additional management and product talent. In early 2013 Naylor re-organized its product and association relationship groups to improve customer service and focus and was acquired in December, ‘13 by private equity firm RLJ Equity Partners, who is providing enthusiastic financial and strategic support to Naylor’s ongoing evolution.

Naylor sees direct linkage between strong communication tools via print and digital media, strong event management, comprehensive job and career services, member research and marketing—and association success in generating non-dues revenue and developing strong member engagement. Done right, stronger engagement can also build dues revenue and added membership.

“The new branding reflects the evolution of our company into a fully integrated association solutions provider,” said Alex DeBarr, Naylor CEO since 2006. “Associations are now seeing how important member engagement is to their survival and success, and non-dues revenue has always been vital to them. We are simply tracking and responding to the needs of associations by talking to them and surveying them frequently. We view our product offerings as an association’s tools of engagement.”

DeBarr added, “The brand refresh and our focus on developing solutions for association challenges are also a reflection of our enthusiasm for using innovation and hard work to help associations succeed in their mission. The branding should make what we do at Naylor clear to anyone, today and in the future. We exist to help associations and their members and sponsors.”

To celebrate the new platform, Naylor will unveil a new logo and look at the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) Annual Meeting & Exposition in Nashville during August 9-12, 2014.
