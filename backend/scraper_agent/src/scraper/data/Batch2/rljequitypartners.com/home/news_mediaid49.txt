BETHESDA, MD//NOVEMBER 9, 2011//RLJ Equity Partners, LLC (RLJ) today announced it has acquired Media Source, Inc. (MSI), the parent company of three businesses that promote and sell children’s books and a variety of services and products geared toward the library industry, including book collection development, magazine subscriptions, book reviews, websites, webinars, and conferences. RLJ Equity Partners, LLC was joined by 21st Century Group, LLC and New Canaan Funding Mezzanine, LLC in the transaction.

"We believe MSI is a very important company in terms of its contributions to improving library systems and public school systems," said Robert L. Johnson, founder of The RLJ Companies and chairman of RLJ Equity Partners. "We are pleased to own a company that is a trusted resource for librarians and school systems across the country and look forward to expanding in metropolitan markets domestically and internationally," he concluded.

Media Source is the leading provider of information content and editorial book reviews for academic, public, and school librarians serving tens of thousands of libraries and more than 100,000 librarians. MSI’s Junior Library Guild (JLG) division reviews thousands of new children’s books each year and selects the best titles in more than 40 different categories. Its School Library Journal, Library Journal, and Horn Book divisions provide critical information and reviews to the library market via digital and print media products.

“We surveyed over 900 librarians and they absolutely love the book selections of JLG.
