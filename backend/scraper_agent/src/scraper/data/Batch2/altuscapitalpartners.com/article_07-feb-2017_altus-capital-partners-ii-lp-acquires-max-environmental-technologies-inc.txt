Wilton, CT, February 7, 2017 – Altus Capital Partners, an investment firm focused on middle market manufacturing companies in the U.S., announced today the acquisition of MAX Environmental Technologies, Inc. Altus partnered with Bob Shawver, an experienced industry operating executive who will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer concurrent with the closing.
