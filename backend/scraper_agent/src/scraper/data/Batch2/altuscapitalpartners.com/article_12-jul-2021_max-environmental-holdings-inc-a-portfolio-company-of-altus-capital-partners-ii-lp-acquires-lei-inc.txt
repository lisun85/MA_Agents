Pittsburgh, PA, July 12, 2021 – MAX Environmental Holdings, Inc., (“MAX” or the “Company”), owner of MAX Environmental Technologies, a fully integrated environmental treatment and disposal company that provides hazardous and non-hazardous waste transportation, processing, and disposal for the manufacturing, energy, and infrastructure markets has acquired LEI, Inc. (“LEI”). LEI is a leading supplier of a full line of recycling and waste management services. MAX is a portfolio company of Altus Capital Partners II, L.P., an investment firm focused on middle market industrial companies headquartered in the U.S. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 

LEI operates two permitted facilities in the highly industrialized Gulf Coast region. Its customer base spans many industries and businesses that include refining, chemical manufacturing, oil and gas exploration and production, waste brokers, electricity generation and distribution and more. This acquisition with LEI expands MAX’s geographic reach into the region, enhances its capabilities with the addition of recycling technology, and provides access to strategically located permitted facilities for RCRA, Universal and Industrial waste. 

“We are pleased to welcome LEI to the MAX team,” said Bob Shawver, President and CEO of MAX. “LEI’s partnership is an important first step in our strategy to expand geographically in the large market for the disposition of environmentally sensitive materials.”
