Nichols Portland holds Grand Opening of new facility for the Pump Division

Portland, Maine., September 24,2019 – Nichols Portland LLC, a leading provider of components (Powder Metallurgy & Steel) and niche assemblies utilized in various applications including fluid transfer, held a grand opening ceremony for the newly added facility focused on assembly and testing of niche pumps.

The newly renovated 20,000 sqft. facility in South Portland, Maine will house an extensive laboratory for hydraulic testing, niche pump manufacturing, and office space for the Pump Division.  Powder metal components will continue to be manufactured at the Congress Street location, while Pump Operations will be moved to the new location at Wallace Avenue in South Portland.  The Pump Division facility will include space for additional manufacturing equipment required for the company’s new business to supply its products to several original equipment manufacturers in North America and Europe.  

Nichols Portland electric oil and fuel pumps are often used by on- and off-highway vehicle manufacturers to assist in reaching their energy efficiency and emission reduction goals. These products are delivered to OEMs in the US, Europe and Asia, and are assembled onto vehicles used all over the world.

Randy Lessard, Vice President and General Manager of Nichols Portland is excited about the economic opportunities the Pump Division brings to southern Maine. “Our innovative products are designed and rigorously tested by our engineering team right here in Maine. Our pumps are built using components that are manufactured at our powdered metal components plant on Congress Street, as well as electronics and machined parts purchased from several other Maine businesses. We are fortunate to be a part of Maine’s vibrant business community and look forward to achieving our growth objectives in our new space.”  Thomas Houck, CEO & President of Nichols Portland added, “Given Nichols Portland’s long history and leading position in the Niche Pump industry, this new facility will help bolster applications in our existing customer base and are excited to offer a more holistic solution to our customers. We are excited about Nichols Portland’s expanded footprint in North America.   Nichols Portland is a great example of bringing additional capabilities to the market, and to be a solution provider / problem solver for our customers”.
