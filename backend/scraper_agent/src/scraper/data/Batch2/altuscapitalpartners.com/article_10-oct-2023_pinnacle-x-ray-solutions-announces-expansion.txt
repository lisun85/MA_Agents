Pinnacle X-Ray Solutions Announces Expansion

EXCITING PINNACLE X-RAY SOLUTIONS NEWS!  We are excited and proud to announce Pinnacle’s 5th expansion in 9 years! Our new 60,000sqft (5,500 m²) facility in Duluth, GA (N. Atlanta) allows us to keep up with the high demand of Industrial Digital X-Ray and Computed Tomography systems. We now have all facets of manufacturing (vertically integrated) under one roof: Welding (Vaults/Cabinets/Manipulators), Fabrication, Machining, Painting & Assembly. Due to the high demand of X-Ray systems, we simply outgrew our old facility. This new facility offers a warm welcoming lobby with spacious offices located in the front of the building. It is also home to Pinnacle industrial X-ray Laboratory (PiXL) our NADCAP & ITAR registered scanning service organization with reading rooms, large training room and a line-up of state-of-the-art Digital X-Ray & Computed Tomography systems.
