GED Acquires Elite Manufacturing Solutions

Adds Machining Capacity and ExpertiseAdds Machining Capacity and Expertise

 

Glenwillow, Ohio – June 12, 2019 | GED Integrated Solutions, Inc. (GED) has acquired Elite Manufacturing Solutions.  GED prides itself on controlling the complete build of our products from basic parts to final assembly.  This total build strategy is a core practice and competitive differentiator.  With this acquisition, GED adds machining capacity, manufacturing engineering support and operations leadership expertise.  GED’s goal is to continue to reduce lead times for our customers while providing exceptional quality products. 

“We are pleased to be adding Elite to the GED family,” says Bill Weaver, President & CEO of GED.  “Elite’s values align perfectly with GED’s values.  The acquisition allows us to expand our capabilities and services to the residential window market as well as to Elite’s customers in Northeast Ohio,” continues Mr. Weaver. 

Elite Manufacturing Solutions, now a GED business, has a stellar reputation as a high-quality CNC machine shop servicing diverse industries.  The business has deep roots in automation and OEM equipment.  The customer-driven approach, advanced machining techniques, and manufacturing expertise has been the key to the company’s growth and success over the last 10 years.  The business will relocate to GED’s manufacturing facility in Glenwillow, Ohio.  While the business will continue to serve their existing customers in Northeast Ohio, this move will also provide Elite’s customers with the added machining capabilities of GED.

“Managing the supply chain, as well as providing products and components made in the USA from Northeast Ohio, is an important strategy of our business,” says Kevin Felix, Vice President of Operations at GED.  “The Elite acquisition captures the ‘’job shop’’ manufacturing approach into the production of GED’s OEM equipment,” continues Felix.  “The purchase will also give the Elite Manufacturing Solutions customer base an extended amount of capabilities and resources; this will allow the business to continue its successful growth as a ‘job shop’-based parts manufacturer.”

GED will retain all the Elite Manufacturing Solutions employees, including Dean O’Malley, Sr., former Owner / Partner at Elite Manufacturing Solutions.  Mr. O’Malley will continue to provide the primary manufacturing engineering for the company’s CNC machining operations.  He has over 30 years’ experience in machining and CNC programming and is looking forward to helping continue to grow GED’s strong manufacturing platform.

Additionally, Dean O’Malley, Jr., GED’s new Manufacturing Manager, will lead, plan, direct, and coordinate the manufacturing operations of GED to ensure quality products are delivered to GED’s internal assembly departments, as well as external customers, by established deadlines.
