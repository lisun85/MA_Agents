Altus Capital Partners, Inc. Acquires ChoiceSpine, LP

Completes third acquisition in less than two years and second in the medical technology industry 

Wilton, CT, November 20, 2018 – Altus Capital Partners, Inc. (“Altus”), an investment firm focused on the North American manufacturing sector, today announced it has acquired ChoiceSpine, LP, a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of specialized spinal implants, instrumentation and biologics for the surgical treatment of complex spine disorders. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Based in Knoxville, TN and founded in 2006, ChoiceSpine, LP and Knox Spine, LLC (collectively, the Company) collaborates with physicians to develop new products which incorporate current medical technology with customized patient solutions. ChoiceSpine™ products include minimally invasive, cervical, thoracolumbar, interbody, lateral, and biologics kits and implants that increase procedural efficiency and efficacy.

“We recognize the need in the medical technology space for proven spinal products that can enhance the quality of life for spinal patients,” said Altus Co-Founder and Senior Partner Gregory L. Greenberg. “ChoiceSpine, a global medical device corporation specializing in innovative solutions for both spinal fusion hardware and biologics, demonstrates a track record of proven innovation, strong sales growth, increased distribution and the necessity of their products in the marketplace.”

Management will continue to invest in the expansion of the business. Altus Capital Partner Heidi Goldstein added, “We look forward to working with Founders Rick Henson and Marty Altshuler, who continue to invest alongside us in the Company, in further capitalizing on the depth of their design and engineering capabilities, sales growth and momentum.”

This is Altus’ third acquisition in less than two years and its second in the medical technology space. The firm successfully completed the tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of MGC Diagnostics Corporation (“MGC”), a global medical technology company dedicated to cardiorespiratory health solutions in December 2017, and the acquisition of Max Environmental Technologies, Inc., an integrated environmental solutions company, in February, 2017.
