ChoiceSpine™ Announces Changes in Key Growth Leadership Positions - Several Sales and Marketing Leadership Changes Made to Drive Company Growth

KNOXVILLE, TN, October 8, 2019 – ChoiceSpine LLC, a privately-held spinal device manufacturer based in Knoxville, TN, today announced several executive leadership changes designed to grow the company’s expertise, deepen its knowledge base, and drive sales growth.

The following changes and new additions have been made in the sales and marketing teams.

KC Gilbert promoted to Senior Vice President of Strategic Partnerships;
Keith Clements hired as Vice President of Sales; and 
Ron Moore hired as Senior Director of Marketing.

KC Gilbert ’s promotion to Senior Vice President of Strategic Partnerships expands his current marketing and surgeon education responsibilities to include: Sales Support and Asset Management, Employee Education and Training, Surgeon Relationship Management, Key Account Management, and Healthcare Institution and Distributor Contracting. 

“ChoiceSpine is very fortunate to have a leader with KC’s expertise and proven track-record, which makes him an exceptional choice for this new leadership role.  KC has demonstrated his strategic-thinking, management style, and surgeon relationships to be key drivers for the company’s future growth plans,” exclaimed Rick Henson and Marty Altshuler, co-founders of ChoiceSpine.

With 13 years of spinal device sales success, Keith Clements recently joined the ChoiceSpine sales team as Vice President of Sales.  “We have known Keith, and respectively competed against him, for most of his previous spine sales career.  Keith’s salesmanship, work ethic, and spine industry knowledge are a great fit with our corporate culture and business goals,” said Rick and Marty.

“We are excited to see what Ron Moore can do as ChoiceSpine’s Sr. Director of Marketing.  His collaborative work style, creative thinking, and industry experience will energize our marketing team to continue to position the company and its product portfolios as industry leaders in the spinal surgery market,” concluded Rick and Marty.

These leadership changes and additions are aligned with the company’s long-term strategic goals and expectations of increased sales growth.
