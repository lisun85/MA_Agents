Founder & Owner Managed Business Considerations

Founders and owners often face a crossroads at the intersection of ownership transition and management succession:

finding a qualified buyer for the business;

educating themselves on the sale process;

identifying and training a successor;

retiring immediately to pursue other opportunities or passions;

staying involved but only in areas that provide a lot of energy;

receiving cash at closing to secure retirement;

retaining a small ownership position to get a “second bite at the apple”.

Learn about one Founder & Owner Managed Business success story.

More than a dozen small business founders and owners have realized their personal and professional goals through a sale or partial sale of their business to Hadley. How can we help you?
