Learn About The Company

Harris Seeds provides high-value vegetable and flower seeds to smaller commercial growers and home gardeners via the Internet and mail-order catalogs. Members of the Harris Seeds’ staff travel throughout the United States selecting the finest of the new varieties of vegetables and flowers for sale to its customers. Harris Seeds has operated in Rochester, New York continuously since 1879.

The Situation

Harris Seeds’ prior owner, a larger parent company, wanted to focus its attention and resources on breeding and selling new seed varieties to large commercial growers. As a result, we were able to acquire Harris Seeds as it was instead focused on serving the direct-to-consumer marketplace.

The Outcome

Over the past several years, we have invested substantially in Harris Seeds’ fulfillment operations, broadened its product offering and developed for it a robust internet presence. This has resulted in an eight-fold increase in revenue.
