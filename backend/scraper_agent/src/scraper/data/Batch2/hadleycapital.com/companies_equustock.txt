Learn About The Company

Equustock manufactures premium animal bedding and litter products, predominantly horse bedding shavings and pellets sold under the Company’s well-regarded Guardian Horse Bedding™ brand. Many of the most recognized and sophisticated participants in the demanding world of horse racing, breeding and training will only use Guardian™ bedding. Equustock is based near Rockford, Illinois with company-owned manufacturing facilities in New York and Virginia plus multiple partner facilities located around the Eastern United States.

The Situation

Hadley partnered with the founders of Equustock to recapitalize the business and provide additional capital to increase production capacity to address the significant amount of unmet market demand for Guardian™ bedding.

The Outcome

Equustock is still in the Transition stage of the Hadley Ownership System™. We are optimistic about the company’s long-term potential.
