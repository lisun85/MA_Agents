Family Business Considerations

The sale of a family business can be an excellent opportunity to address the often competing needs of family businesses:

retained family ownership;

on-going employment for family members;

family legacy in the community;

distribution of sale proceeds among active and inactive family members;

management succession between generations;

potential introduction of non-family management.

"As a sixth-generation owner, it was extremely important to me to find a new owner that would be a good steward of the business, it’s people and customers. I found that in Hadley."

- Charlie Gillinder, 6th generation family owner
