Hadley Capital recently acquired GT Golf Supplies in partnership with its founder, Craig Pollard, and the company's management team. Craig approached Hadley Capital about partnering with him in order to develop a long-term plan for growing the company while also providing him with a mechanism to achieve some personal financial planning goals.
