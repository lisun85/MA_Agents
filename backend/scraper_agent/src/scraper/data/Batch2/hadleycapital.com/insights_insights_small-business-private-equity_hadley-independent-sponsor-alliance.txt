Unlocking Growth Potential: The Hadley Independent Sponsor Alliance (HISA)

January 06, 2025 - 2 min read

Hadley Capital, a private equity firm specializing in small company acquisitions, has been a leader  in its space for over two decades. With more than 30 small business acquisitions over its history  and an active fund in the marketplace (Hadley Capital Fund IV), Hadley continues to set the  standard for success in the small business acquisition ecosystem.  

Hadley’s recently announced Hadley Independent Sponsor Alliance exemplifies its commitment  to fostering growth and creating value in the lower middle market. Tailored to meet the unique  needs of experienced independent sponsors, this program provides both the capital required to  close transactions and a robust framework for driving success post-acquisition.  

The Lower Middle Market Opportunity 

McGuire Woods notes the “vast majority of independent sponsor transactions are occurring in the  lower middle market… more than 75% of the transactions surveyed involved target companies with  an enterprise value between $10 million and $75 million.” This segment of the market is rich with  opportunity, offering independent sponsors the chance to target companies with strong growth  potential but likely lack access to traditional investment avenues.  

Hadley Capital focuses on transactions requiring $2–$10 million in equity, an investment range  perfectly aligned to the lower middle market “sweet spot”. With the Independent Sponsor Alliance,  Hadley empowers capable sponsors to unlock value in portfolio companies while leveraging the  firm’s extensive expertise in small company acquisitions.

What Hadley Brings to the Table 

1. Professional Due Diligence Practices 

Hadley’s access to highly vetted and trusted service providers, along with Hadley’s own thorough  due diligence approach, ensures an accurate assessment of the strengths and risks of target  companies. This rigorous process sets the stage for negotiating legal agreements, efficiently raising  debt financing, and an accurate and timely closing of the acquisition. 

2. Deep Financing Relationships 

Financing is often a key hurdle in closing a small business acquisition. Hadley’s deep, well established relationships with debt providers enable sponsors to secure favorable terms and  structure deals effectively. Hadley’s tenured track record of success in the lower middle market and  our reputation for treating lenders as true partners in each acquisition sets us apart. Independent  sponsors working with Hadley will benefit from our “seal of approval” within the debt financing  community. 

3. Legal and Corporate Structuring Expertise

From complex legal arrangements to tax-efficient structuring, Hadley’s team of legal and tax  experts - including expertise in QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) tax treatment - offers  independent sponsors a critical edge. 

4. Post-Closing Management Enhancements – The Hadley Ownership System 

Hadley’s extensive network of management resources allows for seamless team enhancements  post-acquisition. Whether it’s finding key personnel or improving operational strategies, Hadley’s  support ensures target companies are well-positioned for growth. 

At the heart of Hadley’s value creation model is the Hadley Ownership System, a proprietary  framework for developing and growing companies. This system focuses on aligning leadership,  streamlining operations, and driving sustainable growth.

5. Alignment of Goals and Values 

Hadley’s partnership philosophy prioritizes alignment between all stakeholders, fostering  collaboration and trust throughout the transaction process and beyond. 

Economic Alignment: A Shared Path to Success 

Hadley’s Independent Sponsor Alliance is structured to align interests of all parties, ensuring that  every stakeholder—from the sponsor to the target company management team—benefits from the  success of the transaction. The program’s economics reflect the standards of the independent  sponsor community while introducing elements designed to foster trust and collaboration. 

Key Economic Features 
Closing Fees: Independent sponsors receive a competitive percentage of closing fees, with  Hadley participating proportionately. 
Closing Fee Rollover: Independent sponsors are encouraged to roll over a portion of their  closing fees as pari-passu equity. 
Management Fees: Shared management fees subject to the target company’s EBITDA.
Equity Participation: Independent sponsors enjoy pari-passu equity participation rights for  all closing fee rollovers and hard investments in the target company. 
Equity Promote: Sponsor equity promote tied to long-term value creation. 
Transaction Expenses: Hadley shoulders pre-closing costs, including due diligence and  legal expenses, reducing the financial burden on sponsors during the deal process. 
Proven Success: A Recent Case Study 

Hadley recently partnered with an experienced independent sponsor to complete a significant  lower middle market acquisition, demonstrating the program’s potential. In this case, Hadley provided over $12 million in equity financing and facilitated an additional $25 million in debt  financing. This collaborative effort enabled the sponsor to close the deal efficiently and establish a  solid foundation for post-acquisition growth. Less than a year later, the partnership formed  between Hadley and the independent sponsor has resulted in a successful transition from the  target company founders and a greater than 20% per annum revenue growth rate.  

Ideal Transactions for the Program 

Hadley’s Independent Sponsor Alliance is designed for transactions that meet the following criteria:

Market Purchase Price: Fair and reasonable valuations
Growth Potential: Clear opportunities for expansion and operational improvement
Target Industries: Light manufacturing, business services, and specialty distribution
Alignment: Shared values and strategic goals between the sponsor and Hadley 

Independent sponsors with deals under Letter of Intent (LOI) are encouraged to engage with Hadley  early in the process. The firm evaluates opportunities quickly and confidentially, ensuring timely  feedback and decision-making.
