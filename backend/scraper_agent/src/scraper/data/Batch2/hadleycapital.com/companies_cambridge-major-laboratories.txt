Learn About The Company

Cambridge Major Laboratories provides advanced chemistry solutions to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Cambridge Major produces small-scale pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used to manufacture drugs from clinical development all the way through commercial manufacturing.

The Situation

We partnered with the company’s chief chemist to purchase Cambridge Major from the widow of the company’s founder. She had been running the business for a few years following her husband’s death and wanted to retire.

The Outcome

Following the acquisition, the chief chemist stepped into the role of President. He quickly grew Cambridge Major into a major force in the world of small-scale pharmaceutical ingredients, growing the company very rapidly over several years. In 2013, we sold Cambridge Major to AAIPharma Services Corp., a leading provider of pharmaceutical analytical testing, product development and manufacturing services worldwide. The combined company was subsequently renamed Alcami.
