ScaleCo Capital Announces Sale of Cap City Dental Lab

ScaleCo Capital (“ScaleCo”), a Cleveland-based private equity firm, is excited to announce the successful sale of its portfolio company, Cap City Dental Lab, dba Dental Alliance Group (“Cap City”).

Founded in 2001, Cap City is a national dental lab that delivers high-quality dental implants such as crowns, dentures, partials, and bridges to dentists, dental service organizations, and other dental labs. Headquartered  in Columbus, Ohio, with seven other locations across the United States, this transaction highlights another successful exit in ScaleCo’s proven strategy of investing in local companies and scaling them nationally.  ScaleCo acquired Cap City in 2018, opened four new lab locations, and acquired three existing dental labs.

“We are thrilled to have partnered with Chris Pendry (CEO), Bill Underwood (CFO), Mike Smith (VP Ops), and the entire Cap City team and are proud of their accomplishments. The leadership team’s dedication to innovation, technology, and outstanding service has positioned the company for ongoing success,” commented Brendan Anderson, ScaleCo’s Founder & Managing Partner. “ScaleCo Capital is excited to continue learning from and building local companies with great operating and investor partners.”
