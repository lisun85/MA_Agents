Excellere Capital Fund III, L.P. Announces Continuation of Commitment Period Following Overwhelmingly Affirmative Vote from Limited Partners

Denver, Co March 30, 2020 – Excellere Partners is pleased to announce the continuation of the commitment period and investment activities of Excellere Capital Fund III, L.P. (the “Fund”) following a vote of all the limited partner interests in the Fund. The Fund entered into an interim period following the death of David Kessenich on January 22, 2020. The interim period would have lapsed and the commitment period continued on May 21, 2020 absent a vote by the limited partners to suspend; however, the limited partners of the fund voted to resume the commitment period early on March 24, 2020.

“We are appreciative and honored by the strong support our limited partners have provided by the early and overwhelmingly affirmative vote to allow the Fund to continue its investment activities,” said Brad Cornell, Ryan Glaws, Matt Hicks and Patrick O’Keefe, Managing Partners of Excellere. “This is a testament to the strength of our entire team and our steadfast focus on deploying a multi-faceted origination strategy, disciplined underwriting program and proprietary value creation process alongside our entrepreneur and management partners.”

The Fund currently has investments in AIS Healthcare, Biocare Medical, Concord Technologies, SePRO, and ParcelShield, which entered into a partnership with Excellere on March 2, 2020.
