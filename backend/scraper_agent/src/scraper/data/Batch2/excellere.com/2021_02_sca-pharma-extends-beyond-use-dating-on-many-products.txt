SCA Pharma extends Beyond Use Dating on many products

SCA Pharma’s customers have requested extended Beyond Use Dating (BUD), and we are pleased to help meet their needs by extending BUDs on 69 products to date, while still maintaining our stringent quality controls. We anticipate extending BUDs on most or all of our products.

Beyond Use Dating (BUD) on compounded sterile preparations is important to hospital pharmacies when placing orders for medications. The longer the BUD, the more flexibility a hospital has in planning inventory control and storage, eliminating wasted product, and saving money.

The BUD is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) may not be stored or transported. The date is calculated from the time of compounding.

SCA Pharma leverages our own in-house cGMP compliant laboratory to maintain an annual stability program, to perform additional stability studies needed to extend the BUDs of existing products, and to support the development of new products.

Feedback from customers has been positive.

“We are pleased to see the Beyond Usage Dating (BUD) product extensions for SCA Pharma products,” said Ryan Pepper, assistant vice president, pharmacy supply chain, at Ochsner Health System. “Extended BUDs allow our teams to effectively manage inventory and focus on patient care. We appreciate the rigorous and costly tests that are required and are extremely pleased with the SCA Pharma decision to pursue portfolio BUD extensions.”
