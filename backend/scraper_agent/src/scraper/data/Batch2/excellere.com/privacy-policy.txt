I. OUR WEBSITE

We do not collect any information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual through our website. We and our service providers may collect and use other information as follows:

Your browser or device.
Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that the website functions properly.
Cookies.
Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on your computer. Cookies allow us to collect such information as browser type, time spent on the website, pages visited, language preferences, and traffic data. We use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience. We also gather statistical information about website use in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how it is used, and assist us with resolving questions about it. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting particular cookies from a particular website. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the website.

Pixel tags. We may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to, among other things, track the actions of website users (and email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about website use and email response rates.
Analytics. We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about website use and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ and exercise the opt-out provided by Google by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and similar technologies.
We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the website. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also go to the Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions. Setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.
