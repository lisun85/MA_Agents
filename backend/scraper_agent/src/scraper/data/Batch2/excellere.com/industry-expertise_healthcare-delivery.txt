Healthcare Delivery

THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE AND APPROACH

Our Simple Philosophy to Healthcare Delivery
Empower Clinical Independence

Our goal is to enable clinicians and healthcare providers to do what they do best â€“ care for patients. We achieve it through supportive investments in exceptional people and strategic implementation of efficient processes and cutting-edge technology.

Support a Foundation Enabling Rapid Growth

Excellere partners with healthcare providers and management teams who have the vision to build practices with a unique value proposition to patients, providers and payers, grounded in achieving clinical outcomes, operational excellence and growth.

Focus on Compliance and Quality

Excellere is committed to fostering a culture that prioritizes compliance and quality ahead of growth, as anything worth building is worth building the right way.

Align Interests to Achieve Excellence

We believe that continued healthcare provider and management ownership in partnership with Excellere is critical to future success and often the difference between a good company and true industry leader.

SUB-SECTOR SPOTLIGHT

Behavioral Health

Excellere Partners specializes in partnering with behavioral health entrepreneurs through recapitalizations and management buyouts. More than just a source of capital, we are a service organization providing the knowledge and resources that can transform practices into industry leaders. Our interest in behavioral health practices is driven by a number of factors:

An estimated 1 in 5 Americans live with a psychiatric disorder, an issue further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rising prevalence of serious mental illness has resulted in unmet demand for quality care and an urgent need for cost-effective solutions.
Mental health solution providers with a commitment to clinical excellence, a comprehensive care continuum, and scalable solutions will be particularly well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for services.

Excellere is looking to partner with growing primary behavioral health practices in order to create industry leaders that deliver sustainable value to patients, providers and payers.

Investment Focus

Excellere is actively seeking future healthcare investments within the behavioral health segment (including hospital-based, clinic-based, and retail health) where we have previous direct experience and domain expertise, or have completed extensive industry research and developed a strategic vision for growth.

SUB-SECTOR SPOTLIGHT

Primary Care & Family Medicine

Excellere Partners specializes in partnering with middle-market healthcare entrepreneurs and management teams through recapitalizations and management buyouts. More than just a source of capital, we are a service organization providing the knowledge and resources that can transform physician practices into industry leaders. Our interest in primary care is driven by a number of factors:

Unsustainable, but ever-increasing U.S. healthcare costs
Unfavorable U.S. healthcare outcomes compared to other developed nations
A push towards value-based healthcare alternatives
Growing support for technology-enabled healthcare solutions
Focus on accessible, transparent and convenient care

Excellere is looking to partner with growing primary care & family medicine practices in order to create industry leaders that deliver sustainable value to patients, providers and payers.

Segments of Interest

Primary Care & Family Medicine providers are uniquely positioned to support patient-centered, coordinated care that drives disease prevention and favorable outcomes for patients living with complex and chronic health diagnoses. Primary Care is anticipated to grow at a rate of 4.7% over the next six years due to an increased focus on managing overall patient care and total healthcare costs. Excellere is looking to partner with Primary Care & Family Medicine practices in order to create an industry leader that delivers sustainable value to patients, providers and payers.
