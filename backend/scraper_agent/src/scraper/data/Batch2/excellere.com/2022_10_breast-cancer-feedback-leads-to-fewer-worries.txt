Breast Cancer Feedback Leads to Fewer Worries

When Kelly Ashby went for a routine OB/GYN appointment in March 2022, her mammogram showed an abnormality. There was a mass on her left breast, which worried her.

“I thought, oh, no,” said Kelly.

She had previously needed mammograms every six months instead of annually due to her medical history. “The waiting was always the hardest part. I’m so grateful to Genesis for reducing the time,” said Kelly.

Her doctor told her to go to Genesis Imaging for a follow-up. She was able to get an appointment for the next day.

An ultrasonographer did an ultrasound to examine the abnormality. Kelly thought that following the ultrasound, she would be released and wait for the doctor to call. However, the technician told her she wasn’t done.

Immediate explanations 

“Dr. Lafferty came to see me during that appointment,” said Kelly.

Peter Lafferty, M.D., Board-certified Diagnostic Radiologist with Riverside Radiology and Interventinonal Associates (RRIA) at Genesis said, “Everyone who has a follow-up exam is seen by a radiologist who reads the results for the patient right then.”

This is one of the ways Genesis continues to make improvements. In 2021, Genesis brought in RRIA, a LucidHealth Company, to provide breast imaging services. This means that radiologists play a key role in patient care and interact with each patient who has a diagnostic mammogram follow-up. This enables patients to talk to their radiologist while still at their appointment and not go home wondering about the results.

“LucidHealth’s program compresses the time frame for screenings and results,” said Dr. Lafferty. “When we interact with patients directly, we’re able to discuss results, follow-up tests, care plans or guidance.”

“I left feeling incredible. Usually, when you leave, you wait and worry,” said Kelly. “I received quality, compassionate care at Genesis without needing to travel elsewhere.”

Screenings make a difference 

Regular screenings are now easier than ever, and are still important. Genesis makes it as easy as possible. The goal is to have a patient in and out of a routine screening in 15 minutes.

“The American College of Radiology feels that breast screenings have led to a reduction in mortality rates,” said Dr. Lafferty. “On average, there has been a 1% reduction every year for the past three decades. “Screenings can help catch pre-clinical breast cancer, which doesn’t show up in a physical breast exam. Screenings and exams by physicians andpatients are key to catching cancer at the earliest possible stage.”
