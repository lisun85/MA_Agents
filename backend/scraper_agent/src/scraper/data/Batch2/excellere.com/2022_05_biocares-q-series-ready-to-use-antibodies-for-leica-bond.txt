Biocare’s Q Series – Ready to Use Antibodies for Leica Bond

While every vendor strives to provide their customers with a product catalog that is as comprehensive as possible, the nature of IHC makes it impossible for every vendor to offer every marker in every format. Therefore, instrument vendors make it possible for customers to purchase empty reagent containers and use them to program and load custom third-party reagents onto their instruments. For laboratories that run their IHC stains on the Leica BOND III, Biocare has developed the Q Series, a specialized line of antibodies that have been optimized for the BOND detection.
