Andrew Kearney is Promoted to Senior Associate
JANUARY 13, 2022

Granite Creek Capital Partners today announced the promotion of Andrew Kearney to Senior Associate. Andrew joined Granite Creek in early 2021 and quickly established himself as an astute and influential deal team member. In his first year with the firm, Andrew was instrumental in closing two new
platform investments and seamlessly took on portfolio monitoring responsibilities for the firm’s two medical device investments.

“We were excited to welcome Andrew aboard and he hit the ground running,” remarked Mark Radzik Partner at Granite Creek. “Andrew came with principal investment experience and used his familiarity with the transaction process and analytical skill set to show he was ready for advancement at the firm.”

Since joining, Andrew has played a meaningful role in Granite Creek’s investments in Big Easy Blends and C&C Manufacturing. In both instances, he distinguished himself by quickly understanding the key business drivers and how projected market conditions would impact performance. Moreover, Andrew leveraged this knowledge to build relationships with the portfolio companies and be a thought partner to the businesses as they evaluated strategic considerations.

“Starting during diligence and continuing post-close, Andrew has been a great partner to the finance and accounting team at Big Easy.” commented Craig Cordes, CFO at Big Easy Blends. “Andrew helped think through and organize our business planning process and then worked with us to build out a robust
budgeting and forecasting model that helps provide business insights to the rest of the operating team. We congratulate Andrew on his well-deserved promotion and look forward to working with him on future strategic projects.”

As a member of the investment team, Andrew is responsible for deal screening, transaction execution and portfolio management. Prior to Granite Creek, he was an Associate at Bain Capital Credit, where he was responsible for evaluating and monitoring investments in leveraged loans and high yield bonds, primarily in the technology sector. He holds a B.B.A. in Finance from the University of Notre Dame.
