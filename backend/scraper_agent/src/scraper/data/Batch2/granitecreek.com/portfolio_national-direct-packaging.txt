National Direct Packaging (“NDP”) was a direct marketing company that sold a complete line of moving boxes and supplies. NDP was at one time believed to be the largest independent internet distribution platform of affordable moving supplies in the United States. In addition to selling through its own proprietary websites, many of America’s top retailers and moving companies relied on NDP to act as their fulfillment agent for packaging supplies.
