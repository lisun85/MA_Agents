Granite Creek Capital Partners, in partnership with Boathouse Capital, today announced an investment in The District Communications Group (DCG), a full-service communications firm providing comprehensive market research and strategic communications services, primarily supporting federal government clients.

DCG helps its clients cultivate awareness and incite action through impactful public interest campaigns.

“Granite Creek’s investment comes at the perfect time as DCG moves into its next phase of growth,” said Adam Clampitt, Founder and CEO of DCG. “With the additional resources and capacity this investment provides, we plan to expand on our position as a leader in the federal communications arena, serving our clients and their meaningful work on an even larger scale.”

“

As an American, veteran-owned business that supports our government on critical initiatives like combating veteran suicide and human trafficking, DCG embodies quintessential qualities sought by SBIC funds. We’re thrilled to support DCG’s current management and their impactful work. Our investment will help fuel DCG’s growth, enabling them to amplify services for their clients.”
