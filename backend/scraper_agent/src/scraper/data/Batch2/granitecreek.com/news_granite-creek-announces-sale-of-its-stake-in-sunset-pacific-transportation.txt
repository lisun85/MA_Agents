CHICAGO, July 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Granite Creek Capital Partners, L.L.C. (“Granite Creek”), a private investment firm based in Chicago, announced today that it has exited its equity and subordinated debt positions in Sunset Pacific Transportation (“Sunset Pacific”), a leading logistics provider based in Chino, California. Red Arts Capital Partners (“Red Arts”) and Prudential Private Capital acquired Granite Creek’s significant minority stake in Sunset Pacific, and repaid its subordinated debt holdings as part of a recapitalization of the business.

In September 2019, Granite Creek partnered with Red Arts to acquire Sunset Pacific Transportation. Since that time, Sunset Pacific has successfully executed various organic growth initiatives and completed the acquisition of Radius Logistics, a Surrey, BC-based third-party logistics company. Granite Creek’s investment in Sunset Pacific Transportation was made from its $200 million fund, Granite Creek FlexCap II, L.P. (“FlexCap II”).

“Granite Creek is proud to have supported Sunset Pacific’s exceptional growth over the last few years,” said Brian Boorstein, Co-founder and Partner at Granite Creek. “Sunset Pacific has demonstrated the value of its differentiated business model – derived and perfected by its first-class management team – which has enabled us to realize a substantial gain on our investment as well as put it in a strong position for the future.”

Josh Craig, Chief Executive Officer of Sunset Pacific Transportation said, “Granite Creek’s operational and strategic support has played an invaluable role in helping successfully navigate both a pandemic and a volatile freight market. I have truly appreciated their input and partnership along the way.”
