JANUARY 30, 2025

Granite Creek and Equivu Capital, a South Florida-based private investment firm, announce the sale of its portfolio company, Odyssey Aviation U.S. (“Odyssey” or the “Company”), a fixed-base operator (“FBO”), to Tallvine Partners, an independent investment firm focused on middle-market infrastructure assets.

Granite Creek invested in Odyssey in 2022 as part of a shareholder recapitalization led by the Company’s majority owner, Equivu Capital. In 2023, Granite Creek provided additional capital to the Company to help fund its acquisition of Golden Isles Aviation, a fixed-base operator located at St. Simons Island Airport in St. Simons, GA.

During Granite Creek’s investment period, Odyssey was led by highly-tenured aviation and FBO executives Sal Calvino, Chairman of the Board of Odyssey and CEO of Equivu Capital, and Ken Allison, CEO of Odyssey.

“

We are incredibly proud of the expansion and success we have achieved at Odyssey. The Granite Creek team believed in our vision and provided critical support and capital as we executed on the Company’s long-term strategic goals.”

Odyssey’s growth was further bolstered by Everside Capital Partners, a New York-based investment firm specializing in building portfolios of U.S. lower middle market companies through strategic partnerships with specialized fund managers or direct investments in operating businesses. “Everside, alongside its trusted partner Granite Creek, which led the transaction, was deeply impressed by Sal and his team’s professional expertise, relentless hard work, and unwavering dedication to Odyssey’s success,” said Everside’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner, Moritz Poehl.
