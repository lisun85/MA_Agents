Strength Capital Invests in RW Specialties

  

Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), a private investment company based in Birmingham, MI, is pleased to announce an investment in RW Specialties (“RW” or the “Company”).  RW is headquartered in Denver, CO.

RW is a wholesale distributor of specialty building products serving a diversified customer base located throughout the Mountain West.  The Company has operations in Denver, Salt Lake City UT, Casper WY, and Grand Junction, CO.  The exposure to these high growth geographies has been a nice benefit to RW and the continued migration to these states should drive significant population growth moving forward.

RW was founded in 1965 by Ron Pott, whose family has maintained ownership ever since.  The current management team has an average tenure of 25 years.  After this investment, the Pott family will maintain an ownership stake and the current management team will continue on in their existing roles.

The Company has an excellent track record of growth and Strength is very excited to partner with the RW team to continue the trajectory.  This growth strategy will include partnering with vendors to push new product launches through the existing distribution channel.  Strength also plans to increase the Company’s geographic reach by leveraging its strong relationships with vendors and homebuilders to expand into other high growth areas.

Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included Key Bank, Northcreek Mezzanine and Midwest Mezzanine.  Jaffe Raitt Heuer & Weiss (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
