Strength Capital Partners Acquires Universal Aerospace, Inc.

Birmingham-based Strength Capital Partners, LLC is pleased to announce the acquisition of Universal Aerospace, Inc (“Universal”) located in Arlington, WA.  Universal is a valued-added manufacturer of metallic components, fabrications, and assemblies for the commercial aerospace industry.

Universal was founded in 1990 as a machine shop but has grown over the years to become a vertically integrated business with a broad set of capabilities.  The Company’s production capabilities include sheet metal cutting, bending, stamping and forming, machining, welding, and assembly.  The Company also has its own captive metal finishing operations. 

Strength Capital will seek to grow Universal through support of organic growth initiatives but also through the deployment of the firm’s buy and build acquisition strategy.
