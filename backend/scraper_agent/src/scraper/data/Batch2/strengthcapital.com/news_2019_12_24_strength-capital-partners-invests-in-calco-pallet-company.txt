Strength Capital Partners Invests in CALco Pallet Company

  

Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), a private investment company based in Birmingham, MI, is pleased to announce an investment in CALco Pallet Company (“CALco” or the “Company”).  CALco is headquartered in Richmond, IL.  

CALco is a vertically integrated, full-service wooden pallet manufacturer selling both new and recycled pallets to a diverse customer base throughout the Midwest.  The Company’s operations include a captive hardwood sawmill and landscape mulching capabilities to monetize scrap and unusable pallets.  

CALco was founded in 2007 by brothers Matt and Greg Calhoun.  CALco has experienced incredible growth over its history and has become one of the most well respected, reliable suppliers in its core markets.  The Company’s growth has consistently outpaced the broader industry, which is a testament to CALco’s strong reputation and service.  Matt and Greg Calhoun will continue to lead the Company going forward.  

Strength is very excited to partner with Matt, Greg and the entire CALco team to continue the Company’s impressive growth trajectory.  Strength will also seek to execute its core “buy and build” strategy with CALco, whereby organic growth is supplemented by pursuing strategic acquisition opportunities.  CALco operates in a very fragmented, regionalized industry and is an excellent platform to serve as a consolidator within the industry.  Strength has successfully executed numerous investments utilizing this strategy in the past.  

Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included Byline Bank, Northcreek Mezzanine and Midwest Mezzanine.  Jaffe Raitt Heuer & Weiss (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
