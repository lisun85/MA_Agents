Strength Capital Partners Invests in Chemlock Nutrition

Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), a private investment company based in Birmingham, MI, is pleased to announce its recent investment in and partnership with Chemlock Nutrition (“Chemlock” or the “Company”).  Strength partnered with Cincinnati-based Roebling Capital Partners (“Roebling”) on the equity investment.

Headquartered near Cincinnati, OH, Chemlock is a developer and distributor of high-purity, specialty feed additives for end-use in the livestock feed industry.  

The Company’s products are tailored to meet an ongoing shift in consumer preferences for healthier, more natural and organic food options.  Chemlock’s products generally promote more favorable animal health, higher feed conversion ratios and reduce the use of antibiotics and other inorganic growth supplements in animals.    

Chemlock, founded and led by CEO Arun Mehan and COO Kris Mehan, entered the animal feed industry in 2013.  Arun Mehan spent his career in the minerals / metals industry and saw an opportunity to apply his extensive experience with chemistry to formulate new products for the animal feed market.  Since entering the industry, Chemlock has become one of the fastest growing feed additive and ingredient companies in the United States, having more than tripled its revenue in the last three years.  The Company prides itself on being a valued-added resource for their customers, taking a chemistry-based approach to solving unique and complex problems customers experience through innovative product solutions.  

Strength is excited to partner with Arun, Kris and the rest of the Chemlock team to continue the exceptional growth already underway at the Company. Arun and Kris will continue to lead the Company going forward.  

In addition to Roebling, Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included Enterprise Bank, Harbert Credit Solutions and Northcreek Mezzanine.  Jaffe Raitt Heuer & Weiss (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
