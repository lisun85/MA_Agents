About Mike

As a Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Strength Capital, Mike Bergeron focuses on deal sourcing, working collaboratively with portfolio companies, and capital raising.

Mike is a passionate, excitable, optimistic, and enthusiastic supporter of all of Strength’s companies.  He truly loves working with entrepreneurs and business leaders to help companies grow and get better and help solve difficult problems.      

Prior to the launch of Strength Capital, Mike worked in Sales and Brand Management at Procter & Gamble in the laundry, paper, beauty, and pharmaceutical divisions.  He also served as an Equity Analyst at T. Rowe Price covering financial institutions.

Mike is a board member of six Strength Capital's investments: Pinnacle Paving & Sealing, Chemlock Nutrition, Tenty Distributors, DTM Distributors, Tiedemann-Bevs Industries, and Kansas Golf & Turf. 

Mike graduated with honors from Miami University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance.  He earned his MBA from Harvard University.

During his undergraduate years, Mike interned in the White House Office of Political Affairs for President George H.W. Bush.

Mike is the past Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Summit Country Day School.  

Mike and his wife Annie have three kids (Jack, Kate, and Nick).  Mike loves being a dad and enjoys travel, reading, and all types of investing.  He loves working out including biking, lifting, and men’s league hockey where he is a multiple time champion.  He is also the most tenured member of the Summit varsity football Chain Gang where you will find him on Friday nights in the fall. In another consequential part of his football life, Mike gave an impromptu pre-game fire up speech to the Bengals offensive line before Super Bowl LVI that proved to only be effective for 30 minutes of game time.

He is a passionate fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Ohio State University football team, America, helping young people learn about the capital markets, and listening before talking.  Secondary rooting interests include the Detroit Red Wings, the Detroit Pistons, Arsenal, Diet Mountain Dew, and Buckeye Donuts. Mike also holds the all-time youth coaching wins record for Summit Country Day school with victories in soccer, basketball, and lacrosse produced over a decade of excellence.
