Strength Capital Partners Invests in Kansas Golf & Turf

Strength Capital Partners, LLC (“Strength”), a private investment company with offices in Birmingham, MI, Cincinnati, OH, and Denver, CO, is pleased to announce its recent investment in and partnership with Kansas Golf & Turf (“KGT” or the “Company”). 

Headquartered in Wichita, KS, KGT is a distributor and dealer of golf cars, turf / lawn equipment, and utility vehicles to various customers including golf courses, commercial businesses, municipalities, and individuals. The Company also sells spare parts / accessories and provides repairs services to its customers.

KGT has long-term relationships with several premier brands including E-Z-GO golf cars and Jacobsen, eXmark, and Hustler lawn care equipment. In addition to selling new equipment, the Company also re-purchases, refurbishes and resells used golf carts and lawn equipment. The combination of new equipment sales, used equipment sales and value-added parts / accessories and services offering makes KGT a true “one-stop shop” for their customers.

KGT was founded in 1992 when Pat and Pauline McGreevy acquired a small E-Z-GO dealership. Their sons, Corey and Brian McGreevy, have been operating the business since 1998.  Strength Capital is looking forward to partnering with Corey, Brian and the rest of the KGT team to execute both organic growth initiatives and to pursue strategic acquisitions.  

Strength Capital’s financing partners for the transaction included Enterprise Bank and Northcreek Mezzanine. Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP (Lee Kellert) provided legal counsel to Strength.
