About Rob

As an Operating Partner of Strength Capital, Rob performs a variety of oversight functions for Strength’s portfolio.  Rob is currently CEO of Strength’s portfolio company RW Specialties, a building products distributor based in Denver, CO.  Rob also serves on the board of other Strength Portfolio companies and participates in the evaluation of new Strength Capital investments that overlap with his historical experience.  

Throughout his career, Rob has become known for enhancing existing operational procedures, implementing quality assurance programs, improving cost containment, and overseeing individual employee development.  

Prior to joining Strength Capital as an Operating Partner, Rob was CEO of Inland Pipe Rehabilitation (“IPR”), a trenchless sewer pipe repair business that was one of Strength Capital’s most successful investments to-date.    

Upon joining IPR in 2010 as Chief Operations Officer, Rob already had 30+ years of operations management experience in the construction industry.  During his tenure at IPR, Rob successfully introduced new technologies, procedures, and trenchless rehabilitation applications.  These applications maximized operational effectiveness and performance, reduced overall cost, and increased overall quality.  His consistent and professional approach to daily operations was recognized by his employees and instilled a high level of trust from IPR customers.

Prior to his time at IPR, Rob founded and successfully operated his own new home construction company for 13 years where he grew the business from four to 80 employees with multiple locations prior to its successful sale.  Rob has also held several executive/operations management positions with some of the nation's leading homebuilders, including a role at McCar Homes where he oversaw the growth of revenue from $50 million to $680 million.
