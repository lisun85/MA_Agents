================================================================================
Pleasant Bay Capital Partners (“Pleasant Bay”) is a private equity firm focused on acquisitions, recapitalizations, and minority investments in lower-middle market companies.  We partner with management teams and co-investors to maximize the long term value of our portfolio companies.  Our opportunistic approach provides us the flexibility to invest in a broad range of opportunities and utilize innovative equity and debt structures to fit the specific needs of company owners and management teams.   We have investment experience in multiple industries with particular expertise and focus in Healthcare, Technology, Business Services, and Industrial Products & Services.

At Pleasant Bay, we leverage insights gained from years of investment experience to identify benchmarks for improvements that will enhance value.  By utilizing our extensive network of industry executives, market research analysts, consultants, and investors, we are able to make strategic introductions and accelerate growth and improve profitability.   We work closely with management to develop and implement a post-investment strategic, financial, and operating plan.

In addition, our portfolio companies benefit from the knowledge, network, and resources of our strategic partner, Covington Associates, a Boston-based specialty investment bank focused on lower-middle market companies.  The Covington Associates team brings valuable experience from advising on hundreds of lower-middle market transactions in the industry sectors that Pleasant Bay has targeted for investments.

We build highly collaborative relationships with our management teams to build value through the growth of revenues and profits.  While the day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies are led by experienced executives, we play an active role in the following areas:

Strategic Planning – Evaluating Organic and Acquisition Growth Plans
Management and Board Recruitment
