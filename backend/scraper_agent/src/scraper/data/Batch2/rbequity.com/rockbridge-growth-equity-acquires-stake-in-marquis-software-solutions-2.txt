Detroit, MI, November 30, 2021 – Rockbridge Growth Equity, a Detroit-based private equity firm, today announced it has acquired Marquis Software Solutions from Falfurrias Capital Partners.

Marquis is a leader in unique data analytics software and services that help financial institutions, primarily mid-tier banks and credit unions, identify marketing opportunities and meet complex and ever-evolving compliance requirements.

“We have developed a portfolio specialty in marketing and financial services, and Marquis is an incredible addition to that group,” said Kevin Prokop, Managing Partner at Rockbridge. “Susan Faulkner and her team have built a market-leading company with a broad portfolio of marketing and compliance products that serve banks and credit unions across the United States. We look forward to working with Susan and the management team to accelerate the company’s growth, increase the range of services it provides and target new potential clients that can benefit from Marquis’ solutions.”

Rockbridge Growth Equity is committed to helping exceptional companies accelerate growth and build long-term, sustainable value for its stakeholders. Since 2007, Rockbridge has built a track record of assisting both new and established businesses in navigating their next growth stage.

“Marquis’ goal is to make it easier for our clients to assemble and analyze complex customer data, behaviors and needs into actionable solutions for their customers,” said Ms. Susan R. Faulkner, CEO of Marquis. “Marquis is very excited to have the opportunity to partner with Rockbridge. Rockbridge is the ideal new partner to help Marquis realize its growth potential because of its industry expertise and relationship with the Rock Ventures Family of Companies. We believe their tangible network effects for business development and operational experience will create actionable opportunities for Marquis and our clients.”
