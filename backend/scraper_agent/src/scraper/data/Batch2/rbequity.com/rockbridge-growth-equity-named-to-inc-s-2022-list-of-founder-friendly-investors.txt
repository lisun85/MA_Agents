Rockbridge Growth Equity Named to Inc.’s 2022 List of Founder-Friendly Investors

Detroit, Michigan, October 5, 2022 – Rockbridge Growth Equity, a partnership-oriented middle market private equity firm with a differentiated approach to building and growing companies, today announced that it has been named to Inc.’s 2022 Founder-Friendly Investors list, honoring the private equity and venture capital firms with records of success backing entrepreneurs.

The final list recognizes investment firms that entrepreneurs collaborate with and trust as they receive the financial support they need to help drive growth. All the firms on the list have remained actively involved with the businesses they invest in for at least one year post-investment.

“We are honored to be named to Inc.’s list of Founder-Friendly Investors, and credit our talented team for leading us to this achievement,” said Kevin Prokop, Managing Partner at Rockbridge Growth Equity. “Since our founding in 2007, we have cultivated a range of successful partnerships with both burgeoning entrepreneurs and established businesses navigating the next stage of growth, and we see this recognition from Inc. as validation of our relationship-based and long-term approach.”

“Serving as an investor, partner and catalyst for founder-owned businesses has always been a key element of our strategy,” said Brian Hermelin, Managing Partner at Rockbridge Growth Equity. “We thank Inc. for recognizing Rockbridge Growth Equity as an investment partner that founders can trust with their companies.”

Since its founding in 2007, Rockbridge Growth Equity has partnered and invested in 18 portfolio companies, with five active platform investments in founder-led companies, including one platform investment made this year in The Nest Schools.

“Fully investing in an entrepreneur, and their innovative vision, involves far more than the financial investment. By developing relationships with and supporting entrepreneurs for the long-term, these private equity firms are more than investors, they’re partners,” says Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. media.
