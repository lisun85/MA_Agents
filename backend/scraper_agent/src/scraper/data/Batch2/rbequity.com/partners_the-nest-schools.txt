The Nest Schools operates early childhood education schools across multiple states for infants through school age children. The Company delivers an educational experience supported by a proprietary, developmental-focused curriculum in safe and stimulating educational environments and high-quality facilities. Its “play-based” educational programming is augmented by a fitness-inspired wellness program (“Fit Buddies”), a program emphasizing art and music (“Paints & Pianos”), and a program teaching basic life skills (“The Art of Living”). Its curriculum and program design encourages children to wonder, question, work with their peers, and experiment with different possibilities.

The Nest Schools’ mission to build strong minds, healthy bodies, and happy kids is made possible through its core values of kindness, wellness, innovation, and fun.
