Rockbridge Growth Equity Acquires Protect Environmental

Detroit, MI, October 14, 2021 – Louisville-based Protect Environmental, a leader in the environmental consulting and remediation industry, with a focus on radon and chemical vapor intrusion management, today announced that it has been acquired by Rockbridge Growth Equity, the Detroit-based private equity firm.

This acquisition is part of a series of investments by Rockbridge related to its national environmental services platform, currently operating as RB Home Services. The platform provides property owners and developers, lenders, real estate professionals and home inspectors, and other related stakeholder groups across the country a national network of trusted professionals to tackle common issues related to building and maintaining healthy, safe, and sustainable indoor environments. Given the strong brand reputation built by Protect Environmental, Rockbridge will be retiring the RB Home Services name and will adopt the Protect Environmental brand going forward.

Steve Linden, Partner at Rockbridge Growth Equity, said of the acquisition, “Protect Environmental’s industry-leading commercial business, outstanding brand, and mission-driven leadership team are absolutely ideal compliments to the existing RB Home Services Platform. We are incredibly fortunate to now have Kyle Hoylman and the rest of the Protect Environmental team alongside us, building a true national leader in the environmental services industry.”

As the platform continues its mission of providing homeowners with best-in-class services, Protect Environmental represents a noteworthy foray into the commercial environmental services and products market. As the largest provider of commercial radon measurement and mitigation services in the country, the company adds substantial scale and geographic coverage to the burgeoning national platform.

Furthermore, Protect Environmental will be able to leverage other resources within the platform, including members of the Rockbridge family of companies, to strengthen its position as a leading provider in the environmental consulting and remediation industry. The company will focus on continuing to build out its local market presence through its acquisition of existing service providers in target markets to complement its national presence with strong local market representation.

Protect Environmental Managing Partner, Kyle Hoylman, will stay on in his role leading the company, as well as assuming the role of CEO of the broader platform.

“The opportunity to work with Rockbridge to continue our vision of building the most efficient, effective, and economical national platform of environmental, green building, and energy services is one in a lifetime,” said Hoylman. “I’m looking forward to continuing to lead our effort in developing and maintaining healthy, safe, and sustainable indoor environments for our clients around the country,” he adds.
