OUR EQUITY STRATEGY
Equity for the Lower Middle Market

Plexus Equity Fund I is a $204 million dollar fund focused on alignment and partnership.

At our core, we’re focused on being excellent, long-term partners to help small companies achieve their growth goals. We added the Equity strategy in 2021 in order to expand our investor base and to augment our ability to provide flexible capital solutions for small, growing companies.

Just as we’ve done every day since we were founded in 2005, we remain focused on being patient investors for each partner company. We are thesis driven and we rely heavily on industry experts and our deep pool of talented and seasoned operating partners. We approach each transaction with sincere humility and foundational appreciation and respect for the challenges of founding, building and leading small companies in a complex and nuanced global marketplace.
