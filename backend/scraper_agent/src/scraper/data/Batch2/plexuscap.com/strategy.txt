Working With Us

Plexus Capital focuses on investments in people and partnerships in lower middle market businesses. Our capital is flexible and can be customized to provide the right capital structure to position our partner companies for success post-transaction.

HOW WE APPROACH CREATING VALUE

The Plexus Value Creation Method was designed to be a repeatable process to create value and drive returns for our partner companies.

One Team. Flexible Capital.
DEBT & EQUITY

Plexus Capital Fund VI is a $554 million dollar fund focused on supporting independent sponsors, search funds, equity funds, and management teams in recapitalizations or growth investments. Our investments take the form of debt with an equity co-investment.

The focus is on companies with $2 million to $15 million of EBITDA. Our initial checks are typically $5 million to $25 million with the ability to scale our investment in excess of $50 million via delay draw facilities so our partners can focus on growth and value creation instead of refinancings, which can beÂ  burdensome to the teams and our partners.
