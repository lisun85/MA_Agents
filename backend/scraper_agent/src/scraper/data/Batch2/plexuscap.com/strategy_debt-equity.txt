OUR DEBT AND EQUITY STRATEGY
Flexible Capital Solutions for the Lower Middle Market

From inception, Plexus has invested debt with equity co-invest in support of independent sponsors, search funds, and private equity funds.

Through this strategy, Plexus has deployed $2.5 billion into over 193 platforms where our capital was used in independent sponsor transactions for one stop financings or debt with a minority co-investment alongside search equity investors or private equity funds.

The focus on deals with $2 million to $15 million of EBITDA allows Plexus to provide standalone investments of $5 million or write larger checks and grow with the platforms via delay draw facilities. Plexus has invested up to $75 million in a single platform.
