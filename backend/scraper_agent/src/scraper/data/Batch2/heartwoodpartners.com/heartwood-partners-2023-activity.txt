================================================================================
Despite 2023’s high interest rate environment and the resultant challenged operating and leveraged buyout environment, Heartwood’s strength, stability and support found in its value-added resources and lower-debt, equity-rich approach permitted our management teams to stay focused on growing their businesses. Notably, this approach contributed to Heartwood’s ability to close a platform investment in a fifth-generation family-run company, complete ten add-in investments and achieve two successful portfolio company exits. We are also pleased to announce the final close of Heartwood Partners IV, LP.  Along the way, we recognized the outstanding performance of three members of our team with well-deserved promotions and added three fantastic new members. We are excited to be well positioned for 2024 with dry powder and a strong portfolio of companies.
