Heartwood Partners is honored that M&Q Holdings’ division The Outlook Group has won the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce (WMC) Business Friend of the Environment (BFOE) Award for Sustainability. This 32nd Annual BFOE is awarded to the Wisconsin company are doing the most in the areas of sustainability, innovative technology, and environmental stewardship.

Heartwood Partners is dedicated to recognizing the importance of responsible management of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors within our own firm and the companies with which we partner, like the Outlook Group. We are proud of the focus and commitment that The Outlook Group has for more environmentally friendly packaging. They have introduced packaging products that will biodegrade in a standard landfill environment and do not require consumers to change their recycling habits.

Jim Woller, The Outlook Group’s Director of Market Development – Flexible Packaging, noted, “As producers and consumers are bombarded with the Three R’s – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle – we like to remind them of the Fourth R – Reality. And the reality is that infrastructure and cost frequently make recycle-ready and compostable packaging options unrealistic. Outlook Group’s Oil2Soil biodegradable films provide a sustainable product that actually is sustainable, even in Reality.”

Heartwood Partners has a track record of partnering with family and management owners to help them continue to build their businesses.  Our approach combines strategic execution with conservative capital structures to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.  Please visit the Heartwood Partners website at www.heartwoodpartners.com to review our approach and investment portfolio.
