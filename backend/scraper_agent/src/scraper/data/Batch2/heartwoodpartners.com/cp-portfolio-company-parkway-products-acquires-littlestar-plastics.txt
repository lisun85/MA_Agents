Parkway Products, LLC (“Parkway” www.parkwayproducts.com) acquired Littlestar Plastics (“Littlestar” www.littlestarplastics.com) from CEO & Founder, Philip Preston, on January 7, 2019. The Machesney Park, IL business adds unrivaled high-volume machined plastic production capability and strengthens Parkway’s market leading position in advanced and ultra-performance material processing. “Littlestar is an exceptional operation with specialized capabilities that we are excited to introduce to our customers,” noted Parkway CEO, Al Ridilla, adding “the merger combines our collective leadership in production of components from Torlon® and PEEK, feeds our aerospace growth initiatives in concert with our other AS9100 facilities, and serves a demand for world-class machined plastic production solutions that we have from many customers.”

“This combination brings the capabilities of Parkway’s eight US and Mexico operating facilities and six production technologies to our customers,” commented Mr. Preston. “We have been working together on the details of this union for some time and we got it right.” The Machesney Park, IL facility will continue operations with the current leadership team and becomes Parkway’s ninth North American production facility. Mr. Preston will join Parkway in a key role directing Aerospace development and technology integration. Parkway plans to align the Machesney Park, IL team closely with its advanced technology Magnesium Thixomolding® facility in Loveland, CO and high performance plastic molding operation in Atlanta, GA and anticipates engagement with all of its US facilities.
