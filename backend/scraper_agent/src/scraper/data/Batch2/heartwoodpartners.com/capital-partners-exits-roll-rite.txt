================================================================================
Capital Partners Holdings, Inc. (“Capital Partners®”) is pleased to announce that on November 30, 2018, Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund, LP, co-investors and Roll·Rite® management owners sold Roll·Rite®, LLC (“Roll·Rite®” or the “Company”) (www.rollrite.com) to SafeFleet Holdings, LLC (“SafeFleet”), a portfolio company of Oak Hill Capital Partners. Roll·Rite® designs and manufactures state-of-the-art, automated tarp systems for the heavy duty trucking industry serving the construction, agriculture, waste and recycling markets. Roll·Rite® and Pultarps branded systems quickly and reliably contain and protect payloads, create a safer working environment for drivers, and maximize operator return-on-investment by increasing revenues and reducing cost of ownership. Roll·Rite® sells to fleets, distributors, truckbody and trailer manufacturers, and operates three installation centers. It is estimated that there are more than 150,000 trucks and trailers on the road today equipped with a Roll·Rite® or PullTarps branded system.

Roll·Rite® President, Brad Templeman commented, “Capital Partners® support and their equity-rich investment structure involving only moderate debt and a distribution income enabling long-term ownership, empowered Roll·Rite® to accelerate its strategic development during our seven-year partnership. Together, our accomplishments included a larger, more-efficient plant, implementing lean manufacturing, increasing our investment in engineering and product development, defending our intellectual property, opening an additional installation center, and completing two corporate acquisitions.”

Current management of Roll-Rite will continue to lead the business going forward within Safe Fleet. Brad Templeman remarked “This is a great outcome because joining Safe Fleet validates Roll·Rite®’s leadership in automated tarp systems for the global heavy-duty trucking market while also providing a catalyst for future growth.”

Cleary Gull served as exclusive financial adviser to Roll·Rite® and its investors.
