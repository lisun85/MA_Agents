TITLE: Capital Partners Invests in Minimizer Alongside Shareholders and Management - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
Capital Partners® is pleased to announce that Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund III, LP completed an investment in Minimizer, LLC (“Minimizer”) on August 31, 2018 in partnership with its shareholders and management, who will continue to lead the company.

Headquartered in Blooming Prairie, Minnesota, Minimizer is a leading manufacturer and distributor of branded heavy-duty truck aftermarket accessories. Its products include fenders, brackets, floor mats, seats and several other product lines in and on the truck. Minimizer prides itself on its ability to leverage numerous marketing activities to reach end users, grow brand awareness and drive sales growth through their extensive distributor network.

“We are very excited about our new relationship with Capital Partners,” said Minimizer CEO and President, Christopher Thorpe (“CT”). “Over the last six months we conducted an exhaustive search for the right investor; one who shared our cultural beliefs and plans for growth over the next five years. Capital Partners is an ideal fit to help take Minimizer to the next level.”

Former Minimizer CEO, Craig Kruckeberg will remain active and invested in the company.

“This is the best of both worlds for me, personally,” said Kruckeberg. “While I will remain very much involved with Minimizer, this partnership will allow me to pursue other interests, including the Bandit Big Rig Series. As a second generation owner I wanted a firm that knew our industry and has a history of looking after the people, so I was very happy we could move forward with Capital Partners”

Capital Partners, based in Connecticut, has a history of investing in heavy duty truck part companies. Capital Partners’ equity investment will provide Minimizer with additional resources to support the growth of the Company including investing in new products and additional people.

“Unlike most private equity firms, we use a low debt investment approach designed to support rapid growth,” said Managing Partner Mark Allsteadt. “Minimizer is a tremendous fit for us, with a great owner in Craig Kruckeberg and a committed and talented management team, which remains in place as our partner.”

Capital Partners will assume majority ownership with its equity investment. Debt financing was provided by CIBC. Founders Advisors served as the advisor to the seller.
