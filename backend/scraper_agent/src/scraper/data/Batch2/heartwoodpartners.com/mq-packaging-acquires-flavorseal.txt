TITLE: M&Q Packaging Acquires Flavorseal - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
Capital Partners® is pleased to announce that M&Q Holdings, LLC (“M&Q”), a portfolio company of Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP (“CP Fund II”), acquired Flavorseal, LLC (“Flavorseal”) on February 8, 2018. M&Q was recapitalized in December 2015 with equity sourced from CP Fund II along with M&Q’s senior management team and was CP Fund II’s sixth platform investment. M&Q had previously acquired the operating assets and liabilities of Outlook Group Corp (“Outlook”) on October 17, 2016.

M&Q Holdings was attracted to Flavorseal’s strong management, culture of innovation, creativity, and its knowledgeable, customer‐focused workforce. In addition to Flavorseal’s flexible packaging, netting, packaging equipment and consumables products, M&Q is especially excited by Flavorseal’s Seasoning Transfer Technology, which incorporates seasonings and bold flavors into various forms of flexible packaging for its food processing customers.

Michael Schmal, President and CEO of M&Q Holdings stated, “We truly believe that Flavorseal’s Seasoning Transfer Technology will revolutionize the way packaging is utilized in the protein and food industries. Instead of just protecting and extending shelf life of food products, Seasoning Transfer Technology allows the packaging to become an integral part of the product itself, by enhancing the appearance, quality, taste and aroma to food. We think this technology has the potential to dramatically change the food processing industry, and we are fortunate that Chris and Colleen Carroll, who are the owners and founders of Flavorseal, chose M&Q to be their partner to accelerate this transformation.”

Chris Carroll, President and CEO of Flavorseal, agreed, “I am very proud of Flavorseal’s long history of developing cutting‐edge packaging products like Seasoning Transfer Technology. Working with M&Q will provide Flavorseal an exciting opportunity to continue expanding our innovative product pipeline that customers have come to expect and value.”

By combining Flavorseal with M&Q Holding’s other companies, M&Q Packaging LLC, and the Outlook Group LLC, the company plans to become a one‐stop shop for food packaging companies by offering Seasoning Transfer Technology, films and flexible packaging, netting products, carton board products, labels, disposable food service accessories, packaging equipment and value‐added services.

As with its other investments, Capital Partners® structured the initial M&Q recapitalization and the Outlook transaction primarily with equity and only a moderate level of debt financing to provide a strong balance sheet from which to grow and M&Q maintains an equity-rich balance sheet following this transaction.
