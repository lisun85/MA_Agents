================================================================================
Heartwood Partners is pleased to announce that its investment company Sur-Seal, a leader in the custom sealing solutions industry has acquired Spectex, a New Hampshire based company specializing in custom engineering, converting, and manufacturing of flexible materials. The acquisition will help Sur-Seal and Spectex meet the needs of their expanded customer base.

“We are excited about the acquisition of Spectex, knowing how well they meet their customers’ needs for custom engineering and manufacturing,” explains Larry Faist, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sur-Seal. “We value their experience and leading capabilities with a wide range of performance materials, from carbonized felt to specialty textiles to elastomers and plastics. We look forward to presenting these capabilities to Sur-Seal’s customers.”

The acquisition creates a stronger and more capable combined business that will benefit customers through the expansion of manufacturing and distribution locations, enhanced engineering and material development capabilities, and an ability to serve more industries. The combined organization will continue to provide high-quality products, including gaskets, thermal pads and silicone optics, using the most effective manufacturing techniques available, including custom extrusion, molding, die-cutting, injection molding, and more.

“We are pleased to be acquired by Sur-Seal, a company that shares a common mission and values,” says Steve Rossi, general manager at Spectex. “Our joint resources will improve our materials engineering expertise and market reach to better serve our customers and support growth overall.”

“Heartwood Partners and management remain focused on continued growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.  Unlike most private equity firms, our investment companies keep debt low to support growth,” said Managing Director James Sidwa.  “Sur-Seal has built a compelling business and has been a great fit with our investment philosophy.  We were pleased to help them source and fund this key addition to their business. 

Heartwood Partners is focused on partnering with family and management-owners.  Our approach combines strategic execution with conservative capital structures to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.  Please visit the Heartwood Partners website at www.heartwoodpartners.com to review our approach and investment portfolio.
