================================================================================
Heartwood Partners investment company ChromaScape’s CEO, Seth Tomasch, is featured in The North American edition of International Paper Board Industry. Seth discusses ChromaScape’s recent acquisition of CEL Chemical, a manufacturer of adhesives, additives, modifiers and enhancers used in the corrugated industry. He touches on the reasoning for the acquisition and what plans are for the future. 

Seth highlights how ChromaScape will add value to CEL, getting to know the corrugated sector’s people and companies, and improvements ChromaScape implemented since the acquisition. “The acquisition of the CEL product line allowed us to move downstream into the corrugating market, which we see as a logical extension of our packaging focus”, said Seth Tomasch. “We are excited to add CEL Chemical’s products to our product line. ChromaScape’s focus on quality, on-time delivery and customer service will support the continued growth of this highly-differentiated product.”
