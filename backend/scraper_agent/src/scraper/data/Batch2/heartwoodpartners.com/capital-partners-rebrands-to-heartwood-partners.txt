TITLE: Capital Partners Rebrands to Heartwood Partners - Heartwood Partners

INTRODUCING HEARTWOOD PARTNERS: STRENGTH. DURABILITY. SUPPORT.

As of September 21, 2020 we will change the name of our firm from Capital Partners to Heartwood Partners.  The shift to Heartwood Partners continues to embrace the culture we have developed since 1982, one of integrity and partnership, but more clearly aligns with our unique investment approach.  The term “heartwood” refers to the solid, innermost part of a tree, which yields the strongest timber and provides support to the tree.  We believe this image captures our hallmark lower-leverage, higher-equity investment approach, and integrated partnership style with our portfolio management teams.  Further, we believe the messaging of strength, durability, and support will appeal to family & management-owned businesses, our primary target audience. 


Thank you for your ongoing support. We welcome you to explore Heartwood Partners on our new website www.heartwoodpartners.com
