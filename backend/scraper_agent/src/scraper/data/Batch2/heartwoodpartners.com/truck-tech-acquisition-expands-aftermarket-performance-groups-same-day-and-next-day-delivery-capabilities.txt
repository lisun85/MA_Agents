TITLE: Truck Tech Acquisition Expands Aftermarket Performance Group’s Same-Day and Next-Day Delivery Capabilities - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
Aftermarket Performance Group (“APG”) acquired Truck Tech, LLC from co-owners, Royal Coburn and Eric Evans, on August 16, 2019. The Salt Lake City, UT business adds same-day and first-open-of-business next day shipments predominantly focused on delivery to auto dealerships, a sales channel that APG had not historically focused on. “With access to APG’s resources and inventory, Truck Tech will be able to offer more product to their shop and dealership customers. It will also help APG develop greater expertise in the expedited shipping and dealership markets so that we can roll that out across the country” noted APG CEO Matt Jordan. Truck Tech transitioned its inventory and warehousing to APG’s Salt Lake City location and will continue to operate its expedited delivery model out of that location going-forward. Mr. Coburn will join APG in a key role directing expedited shipping and dealership initiatives.
