TITLE: Capital Partners Exits Derby Fabricating - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
Capital Partners, Inc., founded in 1982, (“Capital Partners”) (www.capitalpartners.com) is pleased to announce that on March 31, 2017, Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP, management and its co-investors sold Derby Fabricating Solutions, LLC (“Derby”) (www.derbyfab.com) to Prophet Equity, a Texas-based private investment firm.

Headquartered in Louisville, KY and with four production locations, Derby is a producer of fabricated foam and non-metallic components for air, water and noise abatement primarily for the North American automotive industry. Derby benefited from Capital Partners’ equity-rich, moderate-debt capital structure used to recapitalize the company and complete a corporate acquisition in 2012. During Capital Partners’ ownership Derby and management developed and executed a transformative strategic plan. Derby made investments in improving infrastructure, such as a new enterprise resource planning system, and added depth to its management team. As a result, Derby generated organic sales growth of 70% during our tenure, far outpacing the OEM automotive industry.

Keybanc Capital Markets served as exclusive financial adviser to Derby and Capital Partners.
