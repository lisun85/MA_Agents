“We are pleased to once again be recognized for our teams’ immense efforts to create a unique middle-market buyout firm focused on partnering with founder, family & management-held businesses. Our higher-equity, cash-yielding buyout model has been very effective in supporting our portfolio management teams to create value through consistent plan execution and in driving less volatile returns through different types of cycles for our investors. This recognition by GCI is especially rewarding as we work to continue to develop and evolve the firm to create even more value for our stakeholders.” said Robert Tucker, Managing Partner of Heartwood Partners.
