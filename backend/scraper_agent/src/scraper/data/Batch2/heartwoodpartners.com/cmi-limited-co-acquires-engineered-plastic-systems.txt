TWO EXECUTIVES PROMOTED

Capital Partners is pleased to announce that on March 9, 2020, its investment company CMI Limited Co. purchased Engineered Plastic Systems (“EPS”) (www.epsplasticlumber.com), a leading manufacturer of sustainable, high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) boards used primarily in decking, railing, and recreational facility products. EPS markets its products under the Lumberock, Bear Board, and Perennial Park Products brands and its products are known for their superior performance in marine environments. The Company serves customers across a variety of residential and non-residential end markets in 50 states and select export markets. EPS serves customers directly through its online sales channel and sales team, as well as through its distributor and dealer networks.

“The acquisition of EPS confirms our commitment to innovation and expands our portfolio of sustainable solutions,” says Duane Bryant, President and CEO of CMI. “Their mono-extruded HDPE decking boards, deck railing, and fence railing add to our extrusion expertise, regional production footprint and ability to serve new and existing customers with a broader array of products. Additionally, EPS’ products are designed to perform exceedingly well in the marine markets we serve.”

“Capital Partners and management remain focused on continued growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions. Unlike most private equity firms, our investment companies keep debt low to support growth,” said Managing Director James Sidwa. “CMI has built a compelling business and has been a great fit with our investment philosophy. We were pleased to help them source and fund this key addition to their business.”

CMI (www.cmilc.com), headquartered in Woodstock, Georgia, has manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Florida, Washington and with EPS, Illinois. The company operates three divisions; 1) CMI is the leading manufacturer of vinyl, fiber-reinforced polymer, aluminum sheet piling serving marine, retaining wall, flood protection, and water control applications as well as some of the most challenging chemical containment, levee stabilization, and groundwater cut-off applications; 2) Gator and Mantle are leading fabricators of aluminum bridge, dock, gangway and access solutions serving recreational marinas, residential and commercial dock and access markets and 3) EPS. The company provides design, engineering, project management and proprietary installation equipment to offer complete application solutions.
