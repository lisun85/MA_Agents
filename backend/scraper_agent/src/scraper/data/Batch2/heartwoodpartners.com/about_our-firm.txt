TITLE: Our Firm - Heartwood Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
THE WORD HEARTWOOD REFERS TO THE SOLID, INNERMOST PART OF A TREE TRUNK, WHICH YIELDS THE STRONGEST TIMBER AND PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE TREE.

HEARTWOOD PARTNERS IS A MIDDLE MARKET PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM WITH AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY ROOTED IN STABILITY, STRENGTH, AND PERFORMANCE.

We strive to create a unique symbiosis for businesses to achieve their goals by serving as a strategic capital partner with an investment strategy centered around low leverage and high cash flow. We capitalize our companies with roughly half the debt typically used in private equity so our companies can thrive in more difficult economic climates or when business challenges arise.

Heartwood Partners seeks to fuel growth trajectories of companies by supporting and instilling confidence in their management teams through a combination of a strong balance sheet and many years of investment, marketing, operations, and human resources experience. 

In addition to committed fund capital, Heartwood Partners also has access to co-investment capital through its Heartwood Investments® entities which offer capital on behalf of its investors.
