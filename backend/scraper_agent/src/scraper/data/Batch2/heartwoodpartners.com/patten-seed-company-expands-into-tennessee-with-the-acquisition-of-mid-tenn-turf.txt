TITLE: Patten Seed Company Expands into Tennessee with the Acquisition of Mid Tenn Turf - Heartwood Partners

================================================================================
Heartwood Partners is pleased to announce that its portfolio company Patten Seed, a multi-generation family and management-run business with numerous farms, its Super-Sod retail stores, and an eCommerce platform serving Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, has acquired Mid Tenn Turf.  This acquisition allows Patten Seed to expand into Tennessee.

Mid Tenn is centrally located within the triangle of Tennessee’s major cities of Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga and has over 2,400 acres of turfgrass in production on two farm locations.  The business was acquired to bring Patten Seed’s variety of turfgrass blends and products, including TifTuf Bermudagrass, Zenith Zoysia, Zeon Zoysia, and Soil³ humus compost sold in a BigYellowBag® into the Tennessee market.  Both warm-season (Bermuda) and cool-season (Tall Fescue) turfgrasses will continue to be grown at both of Mid Tenn’s locations in Manchester and Benton, TN.

“Heartwood Partners and management remain focused on continued growth through organic initiatives and acquisitions.  Unlike most private equity firms, our investment companies keep debt low to support growth,” said Managing Director James Sidwa.  “Patten Seed distinguishes itself as an industry-leading producer of high-quality turfgrass products and has been a great fit with our investment philosophy.  We are pleased to help them execute and fund this key addition to their business.” 

Heartwood Partners is focused on partnering with family and management-owners.  Our approach combines strategic execution with conservative capital structures to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.  Please visit the Heartwood Partners website at www.heartwoodpartners.com to review our approach and investment portfolio.
