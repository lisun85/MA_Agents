To assist our continuing effort to find the best investment opportunities, Capital Partners has added an experienced executive to broaden our business development capabilities. With our new addition joining John Willert, who has been with Capital Partners for the past twelve years, we will have two business development principals dedicated to educating the marketplace about our lower-leverage, cash-yielding investment approach, with an emphasis on investing in family- and management-owned companies.

JOHN M. NEWMAN, PRINCIPAL – BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

John brings to Capital Partners the experience gathered over the course of a twenty-one-year career in investment banking and management consulting. Prior to joining Capital Partners in 2018, John was a Director in the KeyBanc Capital Markets Industrials Group for four years. John also had twelve years of prior investment banking experience with Jefferies & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co. in their industrial groups. John’s experience with private company industrial transactions will enhance Capital Partners’ strong credentials in this sector and continue to build our strength in acquiring family- and management-owned businesses.
