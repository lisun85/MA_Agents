Heartwood Partners is honored to be a recipient of the 2025 Top 50 Private Equity Innovator Awards for the fourth consecutive year. BluWave’s fourth annual Top Private Equity Innovator Awards recognize the top 2% of private equity firms that differentially embrace proactive due diligence, transformative value creation, modern private equity firm operations and corporate citizenship practices.

“We are pleased to receive this award from BluWave for the fourth year in a row as it speaks to the culture of continuous improvement we have instilled at the firm,” said Edwin Tan, Managing Partners of Heartwood Partners. “We believe that the traits this award espouses are core to our approach of partnering with family and management-owned businesses to develop and execute a strategy to enhance their growth potential.”

The Top Private Equity Innovator awardees were selected by a cross-functional committee that assessed candidates in consultation with a broad universe of limited partners, investment bankers, industry thought leaders and service providers in the private equity ecosystem. As part of their selection process, the committee evaluated more than 6,000 private equity firms and utilized more than 75 different factors, incorporating more than 400,000 data points.
