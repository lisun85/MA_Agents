INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

Highview takes a long-term view on companies undergoing a transformation, ranging from rapid growth to turnaround situations.

We invest in middle market businesses, across numerous industries, that are facing an inflection point.

We are constructive, collaborative, long-term partners to management teams to help take companies to the next level.

Periods of Transformation

FAMILY/FOUNDER CAPITAL SOLUTIONS

Investments in healthy businesses where we actively partner with family or founder owners to execute performance improvement measures. Our evergreen capital affords us the ability to be long-term partners and have longer hold periods than competing private equity firms. Our flexible investment mandate allows us to customize our capital solution to meet the needs of stakeholders seeking either a majority control or minority investment partner.

CORPORATE CARVEOUTS

Acquisitions of non-core operations or product/service lines where we leverage prior experience and our single capital source to affect carveouts from larger corporate parents on an expedited basis. We leverage our operational resources to quickly transform the operation into a well-performing standalone business with appropriate infrastructure to support long-term success.

BUY-AND-BUILD OPPORTUNITIES

Control acquisitions of healthy businesses where we can drive a post-close acquisition strategy. We seek businesses in fragmented industries where an initial investment can be a platform for industry consolidation of smaller, complementary competitors and yield significant operational benefits in driving both growth and cost improvements for the combined business.

SPECIAL SITUATIONS

Investments in companies with a fundamental reason for being that need assistance through challenging situations including companies requiring a turnaround plan / financial restructuring, addressing liquidity challenges, or managing through one-time events (management missteps, poor M&A, lost customers, etc.)

CRITERIA
