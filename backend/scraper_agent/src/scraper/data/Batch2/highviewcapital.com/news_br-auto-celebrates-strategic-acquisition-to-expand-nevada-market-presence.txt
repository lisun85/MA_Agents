B&R Auto Celebrates Strategic Acquisition to Expand Nevada Market Presence

Leading Auto Recycler Deepens Footprint in Reno and Strengthens Delivery Network in Region

CORVALLIS, OR – B&R Auto (“B&R”), a leading value-added provider of recycled automotive parts and a portfolio company of Highview Capital, LLC (“Highview”), today proudly announced the acquisition of Reno Auto Wrecking (“Reno Auto”). This pivotal acquisition significantly enhances B&R’s presence in Nevada, further strengthening its delivery network and complementing previous strategic acquisitions in Arizona and Oregon.

With over 40 years of industry expertise, B&R consistently delivers high-quality recycled parts to automotive collision and repair centers, as well as do-it-yourself customers across more than 20 locations in the Western U.S. B&R partnered with Highview in June 2023 to accelerate growth through both organic initiatives and M&A expansion.

Operating two locations in the Reno, NV area, Reno Auto is the largest full-service auto dismantler in Northern Nevada. Reno Auto has built a strong reputation in the region by offering a wide variety of high-quality recycled auto parts and salvage vehicles. Integration into the broader B&R network will further improve service to the region and expand product selection for customers.

“The acquisition of Reno Auto is a significant milestone in B&R’s commitment to continuously enhancing our product selection and service levels for our customers throughout our network,” said Jeff Helget, President of B&R Auto. “We are thrilled about this opportunity to better serve our customers in Nevada and beyond while strengthening our presence in the region.”
