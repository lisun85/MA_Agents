TORONTO AND LONDON, SEPT. 8, 2020 /PRNEWSWIRE/ – Firstlight Media and ThinkAnalytics are partnering to enable OTT and pay-TV providers to deploy powerful new cloud-native personalization capabilities that drive long-term subscriber value.

Firstlight’s CMS offers real-time metadata management, pre-integration of third-party enrichment providers, storefront previsualization tools with real-time and scheduled publishing, and editable electronic program guides. The integration with ThinkAnalytics’ cloud-native Content Discovery Platform will increase the ability of Firstlight’s CMS to deliver enhanced personalized recommendations and content discovery based on a wide range of defined or customized use cases that are proven to boost viewer engagement.

Firstlight Media and ThinkAnalytics will discuss solutions for more powerful personalization during an IBC Showcase event on Thursday, Sept. 10 at 3:00 p.m. BST. The panel will feature: Andre Christensen, CEO and co-founder of Firstlight Media; Juan Martin, CTO and co-founder of Firstlight Media; Gabriel Berger, CEO of ThinkAnalytics; and Bryan Bossard, director of strategic accounts for ThinkAnalytics. Colin Dixon, chief analyst and founder of nScreenMedia, will moderate the discussion.

“The nirvana of personalization is knowing not only the ‘what’ in the viewer’s decision-making process but also the ‘why,’” said Christensen. “The combination of ThinkAnalytics’ suite of tools and our own real-time personalization capabilities will turbocharge our customers’ ability to gain deeper, more actionable insights into content that’s coming – and content that was missed – that matters to the viewer.”

“Keeping audiences engaged when there is so much competition for eyeballs requires the ability to anticipate each new step in the viewer’s decision matrix,” said Berger. “This partnership will help customers drive engagement by enabling more informed, real-time programming decisions that really resonate with viewers. ”
