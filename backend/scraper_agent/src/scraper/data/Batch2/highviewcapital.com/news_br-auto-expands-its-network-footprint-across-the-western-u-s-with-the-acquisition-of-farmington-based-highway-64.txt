CORVALLIS, Ore., Feb 25, 2025 — B&R Auto (“B&R”), a leading value-added provider of recycled automotive parts and a portfolio company of Highview Capital, LLC (“Highview”), today announced the acquisition of Highway 64 Truck and Auto Salvage (“Highway 64”). This acquisition further expands the B&R Western U.S. network into the state of New Mexico and across the entire Southwestern U.S., reaching into the State of Texas for the first time.

With over 40 years of industry expertise, B&R provides high-quality recycled auto parts from its 26 locations in the Western U.S. B&R partnered with Highview in June 2023 to accelerate growth through both organic initiatives and continued acquisition expansion.

Located in Farmington, NM, Highway 64 offers a full suite of recycled truck and automotive parts to both retail and commercial customers in New Mexico and adjacent states. Highway 64 will become a critical part of the B&R network and meaningfully expand its suite of products, services and delivery capabilities.

“The acquisition of Highway 64 will further enhance B&R’s product portfolio, network reach, and service offerings for all of our customers,” said Cris Hollingsworth, Chief Executive Officer of B&R Auto. “We look forward to continuing to deliver on the best-in-class recycled parts and service experience that Highway 64 has been providing to customers over the last several decades, along with the continued expansion of our network footprint throughout the Western U.S.”
