ABOUT

We drive value through a strategic and operational approach coupled with patient capital and an extremely flexible mandate.

We invest in middle market businesses that are facing an inflection point and ready for transformation. This includes corporate carveouts, family or founder owned businesses, and companies requiring investment to drive organic or acquisitive growth.

Capital

Backed by a single source of patient capital, Highview is a perfect fit with business owners seeking a long-term partner.

Culture

Our unique culture allows us to differentiate ourselves and partner well with management teams.

Flexibility

Able to transact very quickly; single capital source allows for efficient decision making.

INVESTMENT APPROACH & STRATEGIES

A Tailored Approach to Every Deal.
INVESTMENT CRITERIA
Our Team

Individual commitment to a group effort – that’s what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.
