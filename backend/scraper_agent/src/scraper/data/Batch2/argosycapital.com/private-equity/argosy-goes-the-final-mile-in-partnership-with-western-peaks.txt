Argosy Goes the Final Mile in Partnership with Western Peaks

Argosy Private Equity is pleased to announce its most recent platform investment, Western Peaks Logistics (“WPL” or the “Company”). Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT, WPL is a provider of same-day/next-day, final mile delivery services in the Mountain West region. Through its routed and on-demand networks, the Company completes over two million deliveries per year to pharmacies, hospitals, retail locations, offices, and homes, located throughout both urban and rural areas within its network. WPL provides services to blue-chip customers in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, lab, office products, e-commerce and big & bulky sectors.

WPL operates a network of 12 locations throughout the region with hubs in Salt Lake City, Denver, Boise, and Colorado Springs. The Company’s freight, customer and network density in the Mountain West, as well as its dedication to the region, enables WPL to efficiently, and cost-effectively, serve both urban and rural areas with a high level of customer service.

“With nearly 50% of revenue tied to the recession-resistant healthcare and pharmaceuticals sectors, growth in their e-commerce business, and an experienced management team, we believe WPL is well-positioned to leverage and expand its network. WPL has a built a unique network servicing rural and remote areas of the Mountain West region which, due to their existing route density, is difficult for competitors to replicate,” said Seth Wilson, a Partner at Argosy Private Equity.

“WPL is excited about our partnership with Argosy Private Equity. Since our founding in 2011, we have significantly expanded the company and diversified the services and delivery geographies we offer our customers. We believe partnering with Argosy will help us to continue to invest in improving our fleet and our technology to better serve the market and should enable us to broaden our network footprint to accelerate growth,” said Tyler Thatcher, CEO.

Argosy continues to seek platform investments for its sixth fund and add-on acquisition opportunities for the existing portfolio. Argosy aims to partner with and invest in lower middle market companies in the Niche Manufacturing, Industrial Services, Transportation & Logistics and Aviation Services sectors that have a substantial ability to grow.
