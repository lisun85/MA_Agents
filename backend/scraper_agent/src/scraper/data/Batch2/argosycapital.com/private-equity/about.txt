ABOUT ARGOSY.
A legacy of integrity.

Argosy believes that when our business partners succeed, we succeed. Since 1990, we’ve striven to build our reputation as lower middle market specialists who deliver more than value – we do right by our business partners and investors.

Today, our SEC-registered investment adviser firm oversees approximately $3.1 billion of assets under management, with teams spanning the private equity, real estate, credit, and secondaries markets. By combining deep expertise with our trusted, transparent approach, we’re setting a higher standard for growth.
