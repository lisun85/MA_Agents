Lessons Learned from CEOs

“Argosy recruited me for the KICTeam CEO role. What I found incredibly useful is that Argosy trusted me to take the reins and valued my industry experience and leadership. They were not heavy handed, they found the right operating rhythm with the Company and me. They were there for support when I needed them and always provided an objective sounding board that was indispensable for me in executing on our business plan.”
