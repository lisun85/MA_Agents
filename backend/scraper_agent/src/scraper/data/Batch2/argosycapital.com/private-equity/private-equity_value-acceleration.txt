CREATE VALUE. DRIVE REVENUE.
VAM™ accelerates growth for small businesses.

At Argosy Private Equity, we believe in being active investors. That’s why we developed the Value Acceleration Methodology, or VAM™ — our proprietary playbook for growing small businesses.

Drawing from decades of experience, our strategic framework institutionalizes best practices across key areas. The result is a more professional organization, firmly aligned around an established vision, culture, and priorities.

Strong focus on accelerating EBITDA growth and improving business quality and costs. With the support of Argosy Private Equity’s experienced operating partners — and our CEO Networking and Summit initiative — VAM™ has helped lower middle market businesses flourish.
