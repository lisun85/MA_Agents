According to GCI, their award program is one of the oldest and most respected programs designed specifically to acknowledge and promote small and mid-sized leading private equity firms that have an exceptional track-record and reputation.

With over 30 years of experience in the lower middle market, a commitment to integrity, and our proprietary VAM™ framework, which aims to help drive growth of our portfolio companies, Argosy Private Equity continues to strive for lasting value for our investors and portfolio companies. We are honored to be recognized once again as a Top 50 PE firm and look forward to building on our partnerships in 2025!

1This award is the opinion of the party conferring the award and not of Argosy. The Top 50 PE Firms in the Middle MarketTM award, issued by GCI on 1/21/2025, was based on 2024 activity. Argosy submitted a nomination, and once selected, paid a nominal amount to GCI in connection with using the award logo. There can be no assurance that other providers or surveys would reach the same conclusion as the foregoing.
