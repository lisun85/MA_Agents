Since 2010, Procurement Partners has been leading the business commerce evolution with its procure-to-pay (P2P) solution. The complete procurement and transaction automation portal, built and supported by Procurement Partners, reduces off-contract spending, and drives efficiency to purchase processes while automatically auditing every invoice. The significant amount of flexibility of the Portal, the ability to capture 100% of invoices, and the capability to service customers and vendors of all sizes have made Procurement Partners one of the fastest-growing P2P solutions in multiple markets.
