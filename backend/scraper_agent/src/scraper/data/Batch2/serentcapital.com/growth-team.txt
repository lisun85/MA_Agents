Founders love working with Serent’s Growth Team
 

”The Growth Team’s approach is very hands-on, but also noninvasive. They not only work closely with the senior leadership team, but they work with a lot of folks across the company, and very quickly, they become a part of the team. Having this bank of very talented folks that are available to come in and help with specific things that the company needs is incredibly valuable.”

Rod Jimenez Co-Founder and CEO, SHR

”The Serent Growth Team is very collegial and collaborative. They’re fun to work with and are really smart people. They’ve seen a lot of different situations in different contexts. They have a lot of value to add. It wasn’t just the classic, consulting come in, take your watch, tell you what time it is. It was like, ‘No, here’s a model, let’s build it.’ They are building it. ”

Amy Brandt CEO, Docutech

”Our value has skyrocketed and M&A is a big lever that we’ve used to do that. If you have Serent’s team on your side, they do most of the heavy lifting for you so you’re able to continue to run the business – which has been huge for us. We’ve done five acquisitions in three years.”

Garret Gray Co-Founder and CEO, Next Gear Solutions
  LinkedIn

”Serent has recruited top-notch, incredibly bright people that come into a portfolio company and try to help them build different growth vectors, pulling different levers to try to help grow our company. One of those levers was this partnership program. Through their help in negotiation, setting it up a process, and hiring, we made huge strides that made a material difference in our trajectory both in revenue and EBITDA.”
