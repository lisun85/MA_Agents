Most mid-market manufacturers are running software from anywhere from two to five different providers. As they migrate to the cloud, it’s critical to look for vendors that continue to provide interoperability. The challenge isn’t just finding systems that work together – it’s that the systems manufacturers are already using may only be enabled to work in an on-premise environment.
