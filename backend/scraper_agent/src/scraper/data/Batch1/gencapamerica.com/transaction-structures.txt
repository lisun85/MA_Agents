A flexible investment strategy allows investments in a variety of transactions. Examples of common GCA structures include:

Management Buyout – GCA is looking to partner with key management who wish to acquire a private company. Cash is paid to the seller, and management is offered a sizeable equity stake in the newly capitalized company. Management retains operating control of the business and gains a strategic and financial partner in GCA.
Corporate Divestiture – GCA also works with managers to purchase divisions from parent corporations. Typically, these divisions no longer strategically fit with the parent company’s core business. GCA provides the capital that management needs to successfully fund and complete the acquisition. The principals understand the complex issues related to a division becoming a stand-alone entity.
Recapitalization – GCA also partners with owners who wish to liquidate a portion of their equity stake but wish to retain operating control of the company. This structure is ideal for owners who have immediate liquidity or estate planning needs but who wish to participate in the long-term growth in the value of their business. GCA’s investment typically allows owners to eliminate personal guarantees.
Family Succession – Younger family members can also be assisted in a buyout of a family business from the senior generation or from outside shareholders. In doing so, the active family members secure operating control and a significant equity ownership, while the elder selling shareholders achieve liquidity. This ensures that the business stays within the family and maintains its identity with the community.
