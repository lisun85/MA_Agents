2024

Year in Review

2024 marked 15 years since the doors first opened at Renovus Capital Partners. We’ve had a busy and successful past 12 months, and we are thrilled to share our Year in Review.

In 2024, we announced the final closing of our fourth private equity fund, which reached its hard cap of $875 million. We also closed our first multi-asset continuation fund, completed five platform investments, 14 add-on acquisitions and eight exits.

We are proud to share that Renovus was ranked #1 in a worldwide study of small-cap buyout firms for the second consecutive year.(1)  We recognize that one of the keys to our success lies in cultivating and maintaining a strong team of staff members. To that end, we promoted top-performing employees in 2024, and we added 13 new members to the team as well. We now have 40 dedicated employees across various departments working together to drive results.

We are active in the market and have already closed two platform investments out of our newly raised Fund IV. We are also exploring several new initiatives, including the build out of value creation resources for our portfolio. 

See below for greater detail on our 2024 milestones.

Firm Updates
Announcing Renovus Capital Partners IV!
Renovus Capital Partners closed its fourth private equity fund, Renovus Capital Partners IV Core Buyout (together with its parallel funds), which was oversubscribed with capital commitments of $875 million. Limited partners (LP) for the funds include university endowments, foundations, pension funds, insurance companies, banks, family offices, and industry executives from both the U.S. and abroad.
Renovus is grateful for the continued support from our LPs, which reflects their confidence in our strategy and execution capabilities. We are also excited to welcome new limited partners from across the globe, including institutions in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

Renovus Ranked #1 in a Global Study for Second Consecutive Year¹
