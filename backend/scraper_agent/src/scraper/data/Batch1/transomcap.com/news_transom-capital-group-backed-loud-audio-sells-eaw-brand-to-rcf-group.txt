Transom Capital Group-backed LOUD Audio Sells EAW Brand to RCF Group
October 18, 2018
Third and final divestiture of LOUD Audio-owned brands EAW, Ampeg and Martin Audio since acquiring LOUD Audio in October 2017
LOUD Audio will now solely focus on further developing and expanding Mackie brand

LOS ANGELES – ( October 2, 2018 ) – Transom Capital Group (Transom), an operations-focused middle market private equity firm, today announced the sale by LOUD Audio, LLC (LOUD) of Eastern Acoustics Works (EAW) to RCF Group, a pro audio company with headquarters in Reggio Emilia, Italy. This is the third and final divestiture by Transom since acquiring LOUD in October 2017 aimed at allowing LOUD to narrow its focus to the Mackie brand and deliver the best possible products and experience to its Pro Audio customers.

“While I’ve truly enjoyed working with all of the brands in the LOUD legacy, now it’s time for us to turn the page and to be entirely focused on building the Mackie brand”, said Alex Nelson, Mackie’s President. “Our companies have long lived in a conglomeration of brands and I believe going forward all the brands are going to benefit from new found focus, alignment and investment. This last divestiture marks a particularly exciting time for Mackie employees worldwide who are now about to embark on a journey of re-invention and re-vitalization!”

In May 2018, LOUD sold the heralded and historic family of Ampeg bass amps and pedals to Yamaha Guitar Group, Inc. and, in July 2018, LDC, the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, backed the management buyout of Martin Audio.

“Simplifying the LOUD business and targeting the professional audio customer segment has been our approach since we acquired LOUD last year,” said Ty Schultz, Managing Partner at Transom Capital Group. “We’re thrilled that we’ve helped a portfolio of iconic brands find new ownership, allowing LOUD to focus on its Mackie brand and deliver the best possible products and experience to its Pro Audio customers.”
