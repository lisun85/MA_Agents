Transom Capital Group Enters EV Market with Acquisition of Webasto Charging Solutions
February 12, 2024

Los Angeles – February 12, 2024 – Transom Capital Group (“Transom”), an operations-focused middle market private equity firm, is acquiring Webasto Charging Solutions, Inc. from Webasto Group, a top 100 supplier to the automotive industry worldwide. Webasto Charging Solutions is a leading provider of electric vehicle charging products and services. Transom is acquiring a major stake in the business and Webasto will remain a minority shareholder.

“Charging is at the forefront of the global transition toward electric vehicles, and Webasto presented a rare opportunity to invest in a business of significant scale and in an underlying market on a hockey stick growth curve,” said Russ Roenick, co-founder and managing partner at Transom Capital Group. “We’re super excited to partner with Webasto to continue delivering best-in-class solutions and playing a critical role during the automotive industry’s historic EV evolution.”

Webasto has invested heavily in electromobility in recent years in order to expand its product portfolio. In 2022, the company made the strategic decision to seek an investor for the wallbox and mobile charger business. Jefferies acted as exclusive financial advisor to Webasto.

“I am pleased that we have gained a partner that will continue the success story of our charging solutions business while continuing to offer development opportunities to the many highly qualified colleagues who are part of the business,” said Webasto Chief Technology Officer Marcel Bartling. “At the same time, this move allows Webasto to concentrate on its core business areas.”
