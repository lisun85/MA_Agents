The Framework For Robust Outcomes

Instead of benefitting just investors or owners, we see private equity as a tool to boost long-term value for everyone on the org chart-from the entry level to the C-suite. Transom aims to generate substantial returns by building teams that can execute our playbook and who live our values across all functions of the business.

ARMOR

The ARMOR framework ensures all
stakeholders are aligned, all timelines
are clear, and all goals have a path to
being achieved

A
Acquisition

Underwrite the investment based on the potential we expect to unlock over the course of our investment period.

R
Restructuring

Radical alignment towards shared strategic direction generates needed cash flow to fund the operational transformation

M
&
O
Monitoring & Operations

Continuous communication with management and staff equips the company to execute its strategic plan and tap into its full potential.

Operations focuses on maximizing efficiency and productivity while evolving the company’s culture to become employee-driven whereby everyone feels heard, respected, and empowered.

R
Return

“Begin with the end in mind”: Target long term, sustainable value while positioning the company for substantial value creation prior to exit.
