Loud audio, LLC Announces The Sale Of Martin Audio London
July 2, 2018

The parent company of leading audio brands Mackie and EAW, LOUD Audio, LLC has concluded the sale of the renowned Martin Audio brand to LDC, a private equity firm from the United Kingdom.

Woodinville, WA – ( July 2, 2018 )  LOUD Audio, LLC (LOUD), a portfolio company of Transom Capital Group, today announced that it has sold the Martin Audio brand from its portfolio of Pro Audio and MI businesses to UK-based mid-market private equity investor LDC. This move is aimed at allowing LOUD to narrow its focus and deliver the best possible products and experience to its Pro Audio customers.

“I’ve truly enjoyed being able to participate in the legacy of this much-lauded brand,” said Mark Graham, CEO of LOUD. “Bringing some of the technical and operational expertise of the LOUD enterprise to Martin Audio and drawing on Martin’s fanatical passion around sound quality created a nice marriage of capabilities. While we are sad to see them go, we believe this change will benefit both businesses by allowing for simplicity and focus. We wish the brand and all the Martin employees the very best of luck.”

Dom Harter, Managing Director of Martin Audio, stated, “Our success to date has been underpinned by providing equipment of the utmost quality to help deliver an unforgettable listening experience to people across the globe. The next phase of our journey will benefit from an investment partner like LDC. LDC has demonstrated a shared vision with a focus on developing our product line even further, and ensuring we have a rock-solid infrastructure in place to extend our global reach and drive market share.”

James Oh, Partner at Transom Capital Group, added, “Reducing the complexity of the LOUD business and re-focusing on high quality audio delivery from consumers to professionals has always been the focus of our thesis. We are very happy to have found a great owner for the Martin business and wish everyone involved much success in their pursuits.”

Martin and LOUD will be working together over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition for all customers, dealers, and distributors.

Sell-side advisors included Latham & Watkins as M&A counsel and Greenberg Traurig as debt counsel.
