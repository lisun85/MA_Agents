After years of battling through day-to-day challenges we have come to realize that outsmarting and outworking problems is not as productive as working together towards a common set of goals. To that end, we developed the Transom Cultural Transformation framework. In short, we believe that everyone who works anywhere deserves to know the answer to 7 specific human questions and that these answers help guide one’s understanding of where their organization is headed, what’s expected of them, and what it means to them on a daily basis. Leveraging Transom’s proprietary processes, management plays a large part in this process and is ultimately responsible for driving stellar outcomes.
