October 18, 2018

SEATTLE – ( October 16, 2018 ) – Transom Capital Group (Transom), an operations-focused middle market private equity firm, today announced it has acquired Gene Juarez Salons & Spas, an iconic Seattle fashion and beauty brand, from Evergreen Pacific Partners.

As Seattle’s first contemporary fashion salon, Gene Juarez introduced Seattle women to best in class service, artistry and innovative European haircutting techniques. Since its founding in 1971, through its commitment and dedication to clients, artistry and innovative education, Gene Juarez Salons & Spas has grown to 10 salon & spa locations.

The company’s relentless focus on excellence, quality and service has driven significant recognition and numerous awards, including: 2018 Salon of the Year (Salon Today); Salon of the Year (Modern Salon); Top Spa in the United States (InStyle Magazine) and multiple “Best Salon and Spa” awards by King 5, 425 Magazine and Seattle Magazine.

“We see an opportunity to build upon this iconic Seattle brand by investing in the physical locations, technology infrastructure, and most importantly, the people.,” said Ty Schultz, Managing Partner at Transom Capital. “We’re very committed to working with employees, artists and therapists to fulfill the Gene Juarez brand promise of a consistent, authentic and quality experience that helps clients look, live and feel their best.”

“We truly believe we have a diamond asset in Gene Juarez Salons & Spas, and we can’t wait to partner with the team to further enhance the customer, artist and therapist experiences,” said James Oh, Partner at Transom Capital.

“We evaluated many potential partners, and the team at Transom fundamentally understood and believed in the brand and saw the significant potential to deepen our existing client and community connections and to further expand them,” said Scott Missad, Gene Juarez President and CEO. “We’re looking forward to setting and delivering on a new strategic plan for excellence across the organization and growth across the board.”

Serving Seattle-area clients doesn’t stop at the salon. The company is committed to giving back to those it serves and is proud that its efforts help strengthen the community and support the health and well-being of clients and their families. Each salon has a charity its team supports and helps by providing volunteers, raising funds and awareness. To date Gene Juarez Salons & Spas has supported more than 200 charitable organizations.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. O’Melveny acted as M&A counsel for Transom Capital and D.A. Davidson & Co. served as financial advisor to Gene Juarez on this transaction.
