July 31, 2024

National media and events company expands industry-leading business-intelligence portfolio with state’s only comprehensive business publication

LOS ANGELES and GREENSBORO, NC – July 31, 2024— Shortly after CNBC named Virginia the ‘best state in the nation for business’ for a record sixth time, BridgeTower Media, the authoritative source for business insights, data-driven marketing solutions and events across more than 40 media and research brands, announced today that it has acquired Virginia Business.

Virginia Business is the only publication dedicated to covering economic activity in every sector and every region of the state of Virginia. More than 47,000 executives rely on Virginia Business for news and insights about business in Virginia, which was recently rated by CNBC as the best state in the nation for business for a record sixth time.

“It’s great to be able to add the core business audience in the nation’s best state for business to our growing portfolio,” said BridgeTower Media President and CEO Hal Cohen. “We see an opportunity to accelerate the growth of Virginia Business — and of business in Virginia — by leveraging the power of BridgeTower Media’s audience platform and best-in-class capabilities. We look forward to delivering even more value to readers and advertisers in the years ahead.”
