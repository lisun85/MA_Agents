Strategic Acquisition Broadens Midwest Market Presence, Reinforcing Leadership in Cybersecurity and Managed Services

Los Angeles – July 30, 2024 – Secur-Serv, a division of Transom Capital Group-backed Scantron Corporation (www.secur-serv.com) and a market-leading managed services provider, announced it has completed its acquisition of C-Net Systems (www.cnetsys.com), a managed service provider based in Michigan. This acquisition marks continued advancement in expanding Secur-Serv’s service offerings and market presence, particularly in the Midwest.

“The acquisition of C-Net Systems is a testament to Secur-Serv’s ongoing growth and strategic vision,” stated Steve Kim, Principal at Transom. “We are proud to support Secur-Serv as it continues to expand and deliver outstanding IT solutions nationwide. This move reinforces our dedication to investing in companies that drive innovation and growth.”

C-Net Systems is an attractive fit for Secur-Serv, and the company’s focus on small and medium size businesses with recurring revenue customers, established operations in the Michigan market and strength in diversified sectors including industrials, manufacturing, professional services and financial services all advance Secur-Serv’s strategic plans.

“Secur-Serv is continuing its transformative growth and innovation in the IT industry,” stated Cathy Pickoski, CEO of Scantron. “Aligning with C-Net Systems on core values and a shared vision for the future makes this partnership a perfect fit. We are committed to providing C-Net’s customers with enhanced services and exceptional support, ensuring they benefit from the latest technologies and strong cybersecurity measures.”

C-Net Systems is Secur-Serv’s second acquisition this year, highlighting the company’s focus on building a world class managed services provider that places a priority on its customers with enhanced managed service and support offerings.

“By integrating C-Net Systems into Secur-Serv, we are significantly expanding the range of services available to their customers. Our focus on cybersecurity is paramount, and we are committed to providing the expertise and larger IT team that many SMBs need but often lack,” added Jason Bowra, Vice President of Managed Services at Secur-Serv.

“We are thrilled to join Secur-Serv, a company that shares our commitment to exceptional service and support,” commented Nick Tobin, owner of C-Net Systems. “As our customers navigate the ever-evolving technology and security landscape, they will be in great hands with Secur-Serv’s industry-leading resources and expertise.”
