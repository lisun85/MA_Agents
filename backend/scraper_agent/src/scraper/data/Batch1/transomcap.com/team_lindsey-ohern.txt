LINDSEY O’HERN
Vice President, Talent & Culture

Lindsey has over a decade of human capital development and talent acquisition experience. As Vice President of Talent & Culture at Transom, she delivers well-aligned cultural and operational excellence by partnering with firm and portfolio leadership teams to identify and drive talent and business strategy. 

Prior to Transom, she served as the Director of Human Capital for Tyree & D’Angelo Partners, a private equity investment firm focused on control investment opportunities in the lower middle market. She was responsible for building and leading the talent acquisition and human capital function within TDP and its portfolio companies. Before TDP, Lindsey worked as Talent Manager at Tatum, a boutique executive search and consulting firm focused at the C-Suite within accounting, finance, technology, and operations at middle-market private equity and privately-owned companies. She held responsibility for the recruiting, consulting deliverables, and project planning for Tatum’s Central region, the largest revenue-generating office within the firm during her tenure.

Lindsey received a Bachelor of Science in Health & Sport Studies, with a minor in Communication & Journalism, from the University of Iowa.
