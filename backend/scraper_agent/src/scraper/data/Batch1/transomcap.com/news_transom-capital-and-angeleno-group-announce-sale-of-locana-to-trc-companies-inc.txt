While we are excited for our next chapter, it has been my pleasure to partner with the teams at Transom and Angeleno over the past several years to build a best-in-class geospatial platform. Their strategic and operational support brought a major upgrade in sophistication to our business operations at Locana and was a driving force in our success.”

“The sale of Locana marks the end of a successful investment that embodies the Transom ARMOR process. Through its partnership with Transom and Angeleno, Locana has evolved and grown meaningfully both in reach and service offerings. Now, alongside TRC, Locana is well-positioned to capitalize on its next stage of growth,” said Ken Firtel, Managing Partner at Transom Capital.
