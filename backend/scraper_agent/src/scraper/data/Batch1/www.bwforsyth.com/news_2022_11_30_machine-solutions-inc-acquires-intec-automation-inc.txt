MACHINE SOLUTIONS INC. ACQUIRES INTEC AUTOMATION INC.
Partnership expands best-in-class automation solutions for medical device, life sciences industries

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Nov. 30, 2022 — Machine Solutions Inc., a provider of advanced equipment and services for the medical device market, has acquired Intec Automation Inc., which offers cleansheet design and build of automated manufacturing systems for highly complex production applications in the medical, pharmaceutical, life sciences and high-tech industries. With 20-plus years of automation expertise, Intec will be the cornerstone of Machine Solutions’ new automation division, further enabling the company to meet its customers’ complex production needs with the most comprehensive range of custom automated solutions.

Headquartered in Rochester, New Hampshire, Intec partners with customers to define a positive return on investment at the conceptual design phase, and carries that through the prototype development and proof of concept design efforts. Intec’s solutions leverage its highly sophisticated engineering expertise and technologies to provide a one-stop service for customers, with in-house mechanical and electrical design, certified project-management professionals, procurement, fabrication, computerized numerical control machining, mechanical and electrical assembly, UL panel-building, debugging, and factory- and site-acceptance trials.

“Machine Solutions is extremely excited to partner with Intec, and this acquisition represents an important milestone for the overall Machine Solutions family,” said Machine Solutions President Brian Strini. “This is a key step in advancing our journey, not only to provide industry-leading manufacturing equipment to the medical device industry, but also to solve our customers’ most complex production needs with automated solutions. Our combined capabilities significantly expand the breadth of technologies we can offer.”

“We are thrilled to partner with Brian and the Machine Solutions team,” said Intec President Corey Marcotte. “Together, we will provide enhanced benefits for our customers, including international field service support and additional depth in engineering expertise. Machine Solutions’ people-centric principles, along with our complementary customer base, could not have been a better fit for a strategic partnership. We are excited for our next chapter.”

Intec is Machine Solutions’ eighth acquisition since joining the BW Forsyth Partners family of companies in 2012.
