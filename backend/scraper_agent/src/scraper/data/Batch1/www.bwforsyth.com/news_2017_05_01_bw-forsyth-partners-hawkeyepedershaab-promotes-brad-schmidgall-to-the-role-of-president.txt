MEDIAPOLIS, Iowa – April 27, 2017 — HawkeyePedershaab Concrete Technologies Inc., the leading global manufacturer of capital equipment for the production of concrete pipe and manholes, is proud to announce that Brad Schmidgall has been promoted to the role of President. In this position, he will lead the company’s sales, engineering and service groups, working alongside Ryan Gable, HawkeyePedershaab CEO and BW Forsyth Partners Managing Director, in St. Louis.

Schmidgall joined HawkeyePedershaab 16 years ago. During his tenure, he has worked out of both the Iowa and Denmark offices, and has been an integral part of various departments, including engineering, marketing and sales. He most recently served as the Executive Vice President of Sales.

“Brad’s varied experience and proven success with HawkeyePedershaab, along with his alignment with BW Forsyth Partners’ people-centric vision, make him the ideal person to fill this role,” said Gable. “We feel very fortunate to promote an internal candidate who knows the business and the team as well as Brad does, and who will be able to offer valuable strategic direction and enrich our customers’ trust.”

BW Forsyth Partners acquired HawkeyePedershaab in September 2016. When working with its operating companies, BW Forsyth Partners takes a long-term partnership approach with the goal to buy and build great companies alongside the talented people who make the business possible.

“I am honored to lead this incredible team and company,” said Schmidgall. “I look forward to advancing a workplace where all of our team members around the globe are valued and empowered to exercise their gifts for serving our customers and fellow team members.”
