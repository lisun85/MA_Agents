FORSYTH CAPITAL EXPANDS INSURANCE SERVICES PLATFORM WITH ADDITION OF PERSONAL LINES CLAIMS ADJUSTING FIRM
Eberl Claim Services Represents Forsyth’s Seventh Acquisition in the Past Twenty Months

ST. LOUIS — June 2, 2015 — Forsyth Capital Investors, LLC, an investment firm targeting the manufacturing and insurance services sectors, announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a majority of Eberl’s Claim Service, Inc., Eberl’s Acquisition Co., LLC, dba Eberl Claims Management, LLC, ETS Holding Company, Inc., and Eberl’s Temporary Services, Inc. (together “Eberl”) by its current insurance services platform company, Engle Martin & Associates, Inc. This is the fourth add-on acquisition for Engle Martin since partnering with Forsyth Capital in April 2011 and accelerates the Company’s growth and diversification in the insurance services sector. Eberl provides a full suite of daily and catastrophe loss adjusting and claims-related services for both residential and automobile insurance claims. These offerings complement the core commercial property and casualty loss adjusting, third party administration and forensic consulting services currently provided by Engle Martin.

“The strong cultural fit with Engle Martin and the long-term orientation of Forsyth Capital made this the perfect partnership opportunity for Eberl as the firm steps into its next phase of growth,” said Eberl founder Kirk Eberl. “We wanted to transition ownership to someone who would build on the legacy that we’ve created and maintain an unparalleled focus on the Eberl employees along with our adjusters and clients.  We are really excited to partner with the Engle Martin and Forsyth Capital teams.”

Engle Martin’s partnership with Eberl is the fourth add-on acquisition completed by Engle Martin in the past twenty months and Forsyth Capital’s seventh add-on to its existing portfolio in that same time frame.  This partnership directly aligns with Forsyth Capital’s long-term investment horizon and focus on building its portfolio of companies into market leaders in the industries in which they operate.

“Partnering with Eberl offers the Engle Martin platform a tremendous opportunity to diversify its core service offering with the addition of Eberl’s highly skilled and talented team members providing high quality services to a comparable customer base of insurance carriers,” said Kyle Chapman, co-founder of Forsyth Capital and Chairman of Engle Martin. “The two companies have long maintained a high level of respect for each other and given the complementary nature of our service offerings and corporate cultures, we believe this partnership will be highly rewarding for all of our team members as we continue to build an industry leading insurance services platform that provides the highest level of service to our customers.”
