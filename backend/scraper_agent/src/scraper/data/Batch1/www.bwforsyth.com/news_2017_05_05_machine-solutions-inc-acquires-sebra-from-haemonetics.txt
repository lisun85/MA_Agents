MACHINE SOLUTIONS INC. ACQUIRES SEBRA® FROM HAEMONETICS

FLAGSTAFF, AZ – April 27, 2017 – Machine Solutions Inc. (“Machine Solutions”) expands its offering in the sealing space through its acquisition of SEBRA from Haemonetics Corporation. SEBRA is a leading manufacturer of tube sealing equipment for blood and plasma centers worldwide, with annual revenue of approximately $6 million. The SEBRA portfolio will be combined with the Vante product line in the Machine Solutions’ facility in Tucson, Arizona. The two teams will work together to serve the existing customer base, develop new industry-leading technology and expand our range of services within the sealing market.

The SEBRA product line complements Vante’s existing sealing technology for the pharmaceutical industry. SEBRA’s long history of providing quality equipment and support to blood and plasma centers will enable the combined Machine Solutions to broaden the support and products it provides to its global customer base.    “We are very excited to bring the SEBRA product line back to Vante, it is a great fit with Machine Solutions’ overall strategic direction and our vision of offering our customers a broader set of options to meet their sealing needs. Vante not only has the knowledge and ability to support the current products but is also positioned to advance the technology,” stated Brian Strini, President of Machine Solutions Inc.

This transaction marks the fourth add-on acquisition to the Machine Solutions platform since Machine Solutions partnered with St. Louis, MO-based private investment firm, BW Forsyth Partners in 2011. The add-on acquisition activity is in addition to numerous organic growth initiatives underway at Machine Solutions, the combination of both the organic, and acquisition, growth highlight BW Forsyth Partners’ commitment to building the global leader of innovative equipment and services to the healthcare industry.
