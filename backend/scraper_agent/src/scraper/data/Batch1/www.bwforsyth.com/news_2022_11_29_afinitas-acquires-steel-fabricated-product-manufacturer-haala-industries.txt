AFINITAS ACQUIRES STEEL-FABRICATED PRODUCT MANUFACTURER HAALA INDUSTRIES
Infrastructure equipment company strengthens capabilities, expands accessories line

ST. LOUIS — Nov. 21, 2022 — Afinitas, the leading global infrastructure equipment and services company, has acquired Haala Industries, a major manufacturer of steel-fabricated products, including rebar mats and wire cone cages for precast concrete and drainage applications.

Headquartered in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, Haala Industries was founded by Dave Haala in 1974 as a fabrication company for local agricultural and construction needs. A designer and manufacturer of top-quality steel products, the company has established itself as a leader not only in fabricated rebar mats and wire cone cages, but also threaded products, and drainage gates and guards. With its range of offerings and reputation for quality and innovation, Haala Industries will bolster the Afinitas concrete accessories portfolio and expand its ability to provide customers with more service and selection.

“We are excited to welcome Haala’s experienced team to the Afinitas family,” said Brad Schmidgall, Afinitas CEO. “Its impressive design and manufacturing capabilities, coupled with our strong operations and product offerings, enhance our leadership position in bringing innovative solutions to our customers.”

“Since our founding, Haala has grown and thrived by providing dependable, economical solutions for our customers,” said Ed Sexe, Haala Industries CEO. “We are thrilled to join forces with Afinitas, a highly respected company that will position us for future success and continue to build on our reputation as an industry leader.”

Reflecting on his many years in business, Dave Haala expressed gratitude for the dedication and commitment of his team members: “Without them, we never would have had the success and growth we’ve had over the past 48 years.”

The acquisition of Haala Industries is in line with Afinitas’ strategy to build the premier platform of concrete technologies and provide a differentiated level of product expertise to producers of infrastructural products. Haala Industries’ extensive variety of products complements Afinitas’ concrete accessory product lines, which include steel and plastic spacers, steel stirrup mats, lifting devices, fasteners, manhole steps and magnets, among other products.
