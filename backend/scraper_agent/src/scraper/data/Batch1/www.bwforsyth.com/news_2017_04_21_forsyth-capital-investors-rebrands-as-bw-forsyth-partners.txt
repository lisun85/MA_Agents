FORSYTH CAPITAL INVESTORS REBRANDS AS BW FORSYTH PARTNERS
The firm continues its partnership with Barry-Wehmiller to invest in the capital and component equipment, and professional services sectors

ST. LOUIS – April 24, 2017 — Forsyth Capital Investors is pleased to announce that the company has undergone a rebranding effort, changing its name to BW Forsyth Partners. This new brand emphasizes the organization’s alignment with $2.5 billion Barry-Wehmiller, while highlighting the firm’s partnership approach when working with its operating companies.

BW Forsyth Partners was established in 2009 by Chet Walker, Kyle Chapman and Ryan Gable, in partnership with Barry-Wehmiller, to invest in small- to middle-market companies in the capital and component equipment, and professional services sectors.

“Since our inception, we have been excited to bring more to the table than just financial engineering,” said Chapman, BW Forsyth Partners Managing Director. “We continually strive to enhance the value of our portfolio companies by utilizing the strategic resources offered by Barry-Wehmiller, while, at the same time, not compromising the entrepreneurial culture and autonomy of the leadership teams as separate portfolio companies of BW Forsyth Partners.”

The firm has certainly made good on its promise, growing its holdings to four platform companies with combined revenue in excess of $500 million, through a dedicated focus on growth through acquisition and operational improvement initiatives, all grounded in the key learnings and expertise gleaned from Barry-Wehmiller. The BW Forsyth Partners team has completed 14 acquisitions in total, with a focus only on areas the team knows well: the capital and component equipment, and professional services sectors.

“With every company we acquire, our goal is to buy, build and keep on building, alongside the talented people who make the business possible,” said Ryan Gable, BW Forsyth Partners Managing Director. “Companies don’t create value; people do.”

To accompany the rebranding, BW Forsyth Partners has launched a new website: bwforsyth.com. The new website showcases the firm’s unique approach to partnering with small- to middle-market companies and highlights its commitment to patience, balance, partnership and flexibility.

“With the great strides Barry-Wehmiller has made in growing awareness of its people-centric culture and focusing on creating value for all stakeholders in a Truly Human manner, we felt compelled to emphasize a stronger connection to the company, while retaining the Forsyth name that we’ve established in the market,” said Jeff Giles, Director of Corporate Development for both Barry-Wehmiller and BW Forsyth Partners. “Additionally, given our desire to further distinguish ourselves from the private-equity model that we believe is too focused on short-term decision-making and financial engineering, we chose to highlight our partnership approach to working with the companies we invest in over the long-term.”
