PennSpring has been selected as a 
Top 50 PE firm in 2025.
There is a New Leader in the Lower Middle Market

Founded in 2018 by proven entrepreneurs and self-capitalized from the proceeds of multiple outlier exits, PennSpring has evolved from family office to among the most active private equity firms in the country – with 10 acquisitions completed to date.

 

At PennSpring Capital, we unlock liquidity, empower growth and elevate executive careers. We are a people-forward investment firm, with a focus on EBITDA opportunities of $750,000 - $5 million. We have the agility to work with companies not yet ready for institutional funding – and the ability as operations and sales leaders to scale them to those heights. We partner with company management, roll up our sleeves and help get the job done.
