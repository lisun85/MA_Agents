New Holding Double Features Significant Technology Investment and Earned Brand Authority

 

LANCASTER, PA--September 10, 2024--Zirtual, providers of high quality virtual assistant services, announced today that it has acquired Double, a complementary provider of standout executive assistants and on-demand services – as powered by proprietary AI. Double brings to Zirtual a broad base of experienced, college-educated executive assistants, significantly scaling the Zirtual customer base and addressable market in real time. Double’s deep expertise in productivity, collaboration and remote-first tools further bolsters Zirtual’s rising competitive advantage.




Acquired Technology Portfolio

Zirtual benefits from the significant prior investment in Double’s industry-leading software suite, the primary recipient of over $20 million raised across four financing rounds. Of the 25 venture investors, luminaries included Eurazeo ($39 billion in assets under management), Index Ventures ($4 billion AUM) and Daphni ($549 million AUM). The centerpiece of Zirtual’s acquired technology portfolio is an AI-driven matching and delegation solution, engineered to best leverage one of the largest and deepest pools of specialized talent available.




An Industry Force Emerging

Under the leadership of owner PennSpring Capital, Double is Zirtual’s third complementary acquisition in 2024. Zirtual previously acquired virtual paralegal specialist Del.Trust and virtual assistant provider Delegated.




“As we welcome this incredible bench of executive assistants, they are just part of the story – the addition of proven AI to the Zirtual platform is an absolute game-changer,” stated PennSpring Capital Managing Partner Lou Castelli. “It gains us substantial efficiencies across our growing workforce, and will make integrating additional acquisitions even more seamless and immediately productive. Zirtual is now ideally positioned to grow value for fellow owners in the industry.”
