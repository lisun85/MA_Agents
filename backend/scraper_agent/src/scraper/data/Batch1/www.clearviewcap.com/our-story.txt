Integrity and trust are really important to Clearview. There are firms out there that are known for saying one thing and doing another. And in the case of Clearview, I’ve always felt that whatever they said they were going to do, their actions have always followed the talk.

Clearview really took the time to understand our business, they brought resources and tools into the initial discussions that others didn’t take the time or effort to do. They showed us from the beginning how our relationship would be collaborative and a true partnership.

One of the reasons that Clearview stood out so much was that they understand culture was a big factor for us and Clearview wanted to keep the culture – they asked some really great questions and everything they said they were going to do, they did – which means a lot in this business.
