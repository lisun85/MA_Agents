Stonehenge Partners Completes Sale of United Retirement Plan Consultants of Ascensus

June 2019:  Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”), a private equity firm based in Columbus, Ohio, is pleased to announce the sale of United Retirement Plan Consultants (“URPC” or the “Company”) to Ascensus, LLC (“Ascensus”). The divestiture is Stonehenge’s seventh investment realization from Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Stonehenge acquired URPC in March 2011.   

Based in Dublin, Ohio, URPC is a national leader in retirement plan design, consulting, and administration services. URPC is one of the largest independent third-party retirement plan administrators in the United States, utilizing its global footprint, scale and local expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions to its clients. The firm provides tax – efficient retirement plans-including 401(k), traditional defined benefit, cash balance, and employee stock ownership plans to over 8,000 clients. URPC serves its clients from 12 sales and service centers located across the United States and one processing center in India.

Stonehenge Managing Partner, Bob Eversole, served as URPC’s Chairman of the Board, providing strategic oversight of the Company during Stonehenge’s investment period. “It was a pleasure to have had the opportunity to work with the team at URPC and drive meaningful growth through expanded product offerings, system enhancements, talent acquisition, and operational improvements in the business,” states Bob Eversole. “We wish the Company and its strong and deeply experienced management team continued success in their future endeavors.”   

Ascensus is the largest independent recordkeeping services provider, third-party administrator, and government savings facilitator in the United States. The firm delivers technology and expertise to help millions of people save for what matters most-retirement, education, and healthcare.

Cowen acted as financial advisor and IceMiller provided legal representation to Stonehenge in connection with the transaction.
