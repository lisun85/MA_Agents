2022 Year in Review

Highlights and Thank You to Our Partners

2022 marked Stonehenge’s 23rd year of partnering with entrepreneurs and family/founder owned businesses across the lower middle market. The firm had another strong year, as we closed our sixth institutional fund ($355 million) and continued to be active in the market with five new platform investments and one add-on acquisition, in aggregate totaling $125 million in new capital deployment.

As we begin 2023, we are excited to continue to partner with great management teams, build winning teams, and create shareholder value. We have plenty of capital to deploy and are looking forward to working with our partners across the middle market community. Below is an outline of our firm by the numbers as well as our investments for the past year. We look forward to working with you on new opportunities this year.
