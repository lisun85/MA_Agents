Stonehenge Partners Supports MRE Partners in its Investment in Curated Events

August 2023: In partnership with MRE Partners (“MRE”), Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”) has completed an investment in Curated Events (www.curatedevents.com) (“Curated” or the “Company”), the premier event service provider in the Eastern US. Curated’s mission is to inspire, enhance, and elevate the human need to gather and make those notable occasions unforgettable.

Curated has a keen eye for design and aesthetics and is proud to offer the largest and most diverse rental selection in the Southeast. The Company also offers a unique set of planning options that bring additional value to our partnerships with a wide array of clients. Those offerings, along with Curated’s depth of stylish and relevant inventory choices, enable the Company to bring a turnkey approach to events that is unique to this space. The Company additionally offers large scale, highly innovative, and customized tent structures for luxury events nationwide through its Skyline Tent Company brand.

“We are excited to be partnering with the Curated team to build the undisputed market leader in premium event services throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Our goal is to provide an unparalleled level of selection and service to our clients,” said David Williams, Founder at MRE.

“We are excited to partner with MRE and the Curated management team on this opportunity. The Company and MRE have developed a well-thought-out strategy to further expand the Company’s differentiated service offering. We look forward to supporting both entities through this next phase of growth,” said Pete Davies, Stonehenge Managing Partner.

“We are thrilled by this partnership,” said Al Dyess, CEO of Curated. “MRE’s values, expertise, and commitment to growth perfectly align with our mission and goals for the future.”

Moving forward, and in partnership with MRE, Curated is looking to execute an aggressive growth plan via organic initiatives and acquisitions.

MRE led the transaction and partnered with Blue Marlin Partners, Stonehenge, Cohesive Capital, and UMB Financial.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
