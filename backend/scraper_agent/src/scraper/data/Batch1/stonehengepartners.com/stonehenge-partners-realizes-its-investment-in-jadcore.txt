Stonehenge Partners Realizes its Investment in Jadcore

April 2021: Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”), a private equity firm based in Columbus, Ohio, is pleased to announce the the sale of Jadcore, LLC (“Jadcore”) to Revolution Plastics, LLC (“Revolution”). The sale is Stonehenge’s twelfth realization from Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III. Stonehenge partnered with the management team to recapitalize Jadcore in March 2014.

Centrally located in Terre Haute, Indiana, Jadcore began as a family owned start-up in 1974 and has grown to one of the largest full-service post-industrial recycling operations in the Midwest. The Company serves both large and small plastic manufacturers, processing more than 125 million pounds of plastic material each year. 

Tom Utgard, one of Stonehenge’s Managing Partners, served on Jadcore’s board of directors and provided strategic oversight during the hold period. “It was our privilege to support Jadcore’s management team during the past seven years,” Tom said. “They have built an exceptional business rooted in sustainable solutions, best-in-class production capabilities, and outstanding product quality.”
