Stonehenge Partners Leads Recapitalization of True North Asphalt

January 2022: Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”) today announced that it has led the recapitalization of True North Asphalt (“True North” or the “Company”), a provider of pavement maintenance and repair services for commercial, municipal, and residential end markets. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, the Company will continue to be led by its President, Nick Whitehurst, who will maintain significant equity ownership.

Nick Whitehurst commented, “We are excited to partner with Stonehenge and leverage their decades of experience and successful track record of growing privately held businesses. The vision and cultural fit between Stonehenge and True North is ideal. I am most excited about the opportunity for our current and future employees to grow with the Company. We plan to continue our acquisition strategy and capitalize on our industry’s favorable tailwinds, all while maintaining best-in-class customer service and a turnkey service offering.”

“True North’s leading market position and strong reputation have positioned the Company for continued growth,” said Bob Eversole, Managing Partner at Stonehenge, who will join the True North Board of Directors. “We could not be more excited to partner with Nick Whitehurst and his leadership team to expand capacity and reach more customers with True North’s full suite of services.”
