Stonehenge Partners Exits Investment in MedVet Through Recapitalization

September 2019:  Stonehenge Partners (“Stonehenge”), a private equity firm based in Columbus, Ohio, is pleased to announce the recapitalization of MedVet Associates (“MedVet” or the “Company”). The recapitalization is Stonehenge’s eighth investment realization from Stonehenge Opportunity Fund III. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Stonehenge initially invested in MedVet in 2013 and supported the Company’s growth with a follow-on investment in 2015.   

Based in Columbus, Ohio, MedVet is a growing nationwide network of specialty and emergency veterinary hospitals committed to delivering the highest quality, most compassionate specialty and emergency veterinary care available in the nation. More than two thousand team members, working in 24 locations throughout the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Texas, and Western United States, help to advance MedVet’s mission of Leading Specialty Healthcare for Pets. Through this effort, MedVet serves more than 250 thousand pets and their families and over seven thousand referral partners each year. 

Stonehenge Managing Partner, Pete Davies, served on MedVet’s board of directors, providing strategic oversight of the Company during Stonehenge’s investment period. “It was Stonehenge Partners’ privilege to back the management team’s vision to execute a national expansion of its unique specialty and emergency veterinary services platform,” states Pete Davies. “This highly successful outcome is a testament to the management team’s deep experience and ability to drive organic growth as well as assimilate a number of strategic acquisitions. We are grateful for the opportunity to have supported this team over the last six years, and we wish MedVet the best as they continue to expand into new geographic markets.”
