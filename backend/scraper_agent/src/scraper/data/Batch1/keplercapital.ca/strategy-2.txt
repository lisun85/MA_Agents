INVESTORS
We are long-term, collaborative investors. We've founded, led, acquired, and sold small businesses and we know this space. Our goal is to ensure the businesses we buy are capable of withstanding the tests of time.

Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.

*We occasionally look to acquire much larger companies if they are otherwise a perfect strategic fit with our mandate; in these cases, we partner or co-invest with one of the exceptional family office investors in our network  

**We occasionally make minority or growth investments in compelling opportunities, particularly when they are within an industry where we have an existing interest or strong opinions about future potential

MANAGEMENT TRANSITION

Most of the business owners we meet are planning to eventually transition out of their management role to pursue other personal goals. However, we realize that every situation is unique. While some owners transition fairly quickly, others prefer to remain long-term to share in the rewards of a successful business. Our top priority is the long-term legacy and success of the business, but we are also flexible and will work with you to understand and appreciate your personal circumstances.

TYPICAL TRANSACTIONS

We value creativity. For the right business, we'll find a structure to meet the needs of all parties. If you have a business that fits our criteria, reach out and we'll work collaboratively to develop a suitable strategy.
