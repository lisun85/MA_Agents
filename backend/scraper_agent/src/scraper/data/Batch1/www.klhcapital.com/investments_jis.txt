Business Description

Headquartered in West Jordan, UT, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Jackson Infrastructure Services ("JIS") is a leading utility and infrastructure service provider to the telecommunications, power, gas, milling, and other infrastructure markets across the West and Southwest regions of the U.S. JIS was formed when KLH partnered with the owner of B. Jackson Construction and Engineering to recapitalize the business and certain affiliates. Since its founding in 1997, the company has cultivated relationships with top-tier telecom and utilities customers based on its award-winning excellence in project execution, outstanding safety record, and quality of work.

Transaction Overview

The owner of the company wished to create liquidity to diversify his wealth and identify a capital partner to support clear growth opportunities. KLH structured an investment that gave the owner partial liquidity for diversification and established a capital structure that provided capacity for growth.
