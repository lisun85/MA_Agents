Founded in 2005, KLH Capital is a private equity firm serving family- and founder-owned, lower middle-market companies. We make majority and minority equity investments in businesses to provide ownership opportunities for key managers and allow owners to harvest the value in their businesses. Our commitment goes beyond financial support as we believe in establishing a collaborative team of peers, all of whom have a hand in the company’s progress. When we combine management’s industry and operational expertise with our own, the company’s full potential is unlocked and value is created.
