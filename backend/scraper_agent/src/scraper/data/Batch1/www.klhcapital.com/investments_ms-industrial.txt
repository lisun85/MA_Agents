Business Description

MS Industrial, formerly Mid-State Machine and Fabricating, is a leading provider of outsourced fabrication, maintenance, and field services to the mining, chemical, power, and general manufacturing industries. Since its founding in 1973, MS Industrial has grown into a complete industrial services organization serving the mission-critical needs of its customers across the country, and has expanded its facility into one of the largest machine and fabricating shops in the southeastern U.S.

Transaction Overview

The Management of this family owned business wanted to begin planning for their ultimate retirement, while also partnering with a growth-oriented financial partner. KLH was able to structure and close on a transaction that accomplished both of these goals, while also providing the capital needed to pursue select acquisitions and continue the tremendous track record of the company to date.

Post Transaction

KLH supported the company with a number of investments in its infrastructure, including the hiring of their first ever CFO, Controller and Director of Technology as well as the implementation of a new ERP system and automated time capture systems.
