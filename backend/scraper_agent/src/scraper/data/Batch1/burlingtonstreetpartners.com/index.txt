About BSP

BSP is a firm owned and operated by partners with decades of experience in analyzing, acquiring and operating businesses. As a private investment partnership, we seek to acquire small to mid-sized companies and invest using primarily our own capital. We aim to be the partner of choice for the thoughtful business owner looking to sell by being flexible, structuring win-win outcomes and following through on our word.

How we do things
Firm

Our word and reputation matters

We understand that selling your business is a significant life decision and will hold information in confidence

We invest using primarily our own capital – this makes getting a deal done simpler and easier

We will not waste people’s time

Investment Process

We invest our own capital so we can make decisions quickly and with certainty

We will only provide a preliminary offer that we are confident we can close on

We believe that by working together, getting to know the owner & management and being creative, we can offer attractive solutions for all stakeholders

We are flexible in designing transaction structures that create win-win outcomes

Post Close

The owner transition, if applicable, will be done in a collaborative and thoughtful manner

We follow through on what was promised and our involvement with the business can vary based upon the situation. We can introduce former business owners and brokers who can provide context on how we work together.

We strive to maintain what has made the business successful to date, whether that be culture, a brand, reputation or relationships. We aim to help grow or enhance what has already been built by leveraging our experience, infrastructure and network.

Unlike traditional private equity or search funds, we have no need or desire to sell a good business after a specific period of time
