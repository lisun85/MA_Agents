About FIRE Capital Fund

FIRE (First Indian Real Estate) Capital Fund is India-centric Real Estate fund.

FIRE Capital Fund was founded in 2005 to address a unique investment opportunity created by the coalescing of favorable economic and demographic trends, the current composition of the Indian real estate market and the fragmented nature of India's real estate development industry. The Fund's investment strategy has principally focused on investments in large format-integrated township projects located in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and the surrounding areas of Tier 1 cities. Such township projects can be characterized as mixed-use build-ups focusing on residential development, but also include commercial, retail, hospitality, infrastructure and/or logistics development aspects. The township projects the Fund expects to invest in primarily targets middle and upper-middle class consumers by offering superior quality products at affordable price points. FIRE Capital Fund believes that superior risk-adjusted returns are available to investors in the Indian real estate market.

Since inception, FIRE Capital Fund has garnered a significant competitive advantage because of its active investment approach. It brings together best-of-class constituencies necessary to conceive, plan and execute successful integrated development projects. The FIRE Capital Fund team has a wealth of experience relating to development projects and managing regional partners and land bank owners with strong knowledge of and ties to local markets, national, state and local government agencies, renowned master planning and architectural firms, construction companies, project management consultants and marketing agencies.

FIRE Capital Fund expects that its Fund will benefit from its continued position as a preferred partner in the Indian real estate development market.
