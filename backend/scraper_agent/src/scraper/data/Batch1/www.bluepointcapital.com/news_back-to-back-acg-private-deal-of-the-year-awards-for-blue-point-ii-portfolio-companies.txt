CLEVELAND, OH (January 23, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners is honored to announce that Trademark Global, a Blue Point II portfolio company, was recognized as the Private Deal of the Year at the 21st Annual ACG Cleveland Deal Maker Awards event held on January 19, 2017. 

Trademark demonstrated exceptional top-line and margin growth, nearly doubling its EBITDA, and cemented its position as the leading manufacturer and distributor to the largest e-commerce retailers in the U.S.; Area Wide Protective (“AWP”) received this honor in 2016. 

“At Blue Point, we form strong connections with the entrepreneurs and managers with whom we partner, and leverage our unique set of resources to help their business grow,” said Sean Ward, a Partner with Blue Point. “In  turn, this drives momentum at the company and contributes to the overall impact on the business, industry and market. We are honored to have partnered with both AWP and Trademark and wish them continued success.”


ACG Cleveland, an organization of M&A and corporate growth professionals, annually recognizes Northeast Ohio's leading deal makers who have demonstrated success in fueling sustainable growth through acquisitions, divestitures, financings and other transactions. Selection criteria for the Private Deal of the Year Award includes factors such as transaction accomplishments and impact on market share, industry and the Ohio region. 




Area Wide Protective Inc. is a leading provider of outsourced traffic management services. Blue Point acquired the Company in 2006, and under its ownership diversified both AWP’s customer base and geographic footprint, leading to significant growth. AWP expanded from a regional business with ten locations into a national presence with 62 locations across eighteen states. The Riverside Co. acquired AWP in June 2015, subsequently completing the add-on acquisitions of Traffic Specialties Inc., N-Line and All State Traffic Control. 

Trademark Global is a leading virtual manufacturer, fulfiller and wholesale distributor of branded and licensed products to large online retailers. Blue Point acquired the Company in 2013 and worked together with management to execute an extensive value-add plan in under three years. Trademark successfully established an Asia-based office to increase its speed to market time and quality control. The steady rise of e-commerce also created tremendous opportunities for growth, which Trademark seized given its substantially improved infrastructure put in place while under Blue Point’s ownership. Bertram Capital acquired Trademark in October 2016.  

Blue Point Capital Partners is a private equity firm managing over $800 million in committed capital. With offices in Cleveland, Charlotte, Seattle and Shanghai, Blue Point’s geographical footprint allows it to establish relationships with local and regional entrepreneurs and advisors, while providing the resources of an international firm. The Blue Point group has a 26-year track record of partnering with companies in the lower middle market to facilitate growth and transformative change. It is one of only a few middle market private equity firms with a presence in both the United States and China, which provides a distinct advantage for its portfolio companies. Blue Point typically invests in manufacturing, distribution and service businesses generating between $20 million and $200 million in revenue.
