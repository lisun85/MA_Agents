CLEVELAND, OH (June 12, 2018) – Blue Point Capital Partners is pleased to announce the addition of Megan Kneipp as its Head of Business Development. Megan will oversee the firm’s new deal origination efforts, strengthen its investment banking and other intermediary relationships, and assist portfolio companies with their add-on acquisition sourcing.    

Megan brings a wealth of experience in the private equity business development space, following her time as Vice President of Business Development at CenterOak Partners.  Prior to CenterOak, she was an Associate at Credit Suisse Securities and previously an Associate in Brokerage Services at Direct Development in Dallas.  Megan holds a M.B.A. with honors from Southern Methodist University and a B.A. from the University of Texas, with a concentration in Economics.

Blue Point will continue to work with Jim Marra as a key part of the firm’s business development efforts and he will maintain his strong presence in the market fostering relationships with key deal sources.
