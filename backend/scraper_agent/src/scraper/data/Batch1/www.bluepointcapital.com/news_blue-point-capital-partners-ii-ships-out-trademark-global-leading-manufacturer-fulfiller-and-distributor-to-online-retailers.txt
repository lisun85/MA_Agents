CLEVELAND, OH (November 1, 2016) – Blue Point Capital Partners announced today that it has sold its interest in Trademark Games Holdings, LLC to Bertram Capital.  Blue Point invested in Trademark from its 2006 vintage fund, Blue Point Capital Partners II – a $400 million lower middle-market buyout fund. Sale terms were not disclosed.

Trademark, founded in 1999 and headquartered in Lorain, OH, is a leading virtual manufacturer, fulfiller and wholesale distributor of branded and licensed product categories, currently serving 32 of the top 100 U.S. ecommerce retailers. In a decade where ecommerce has grown at a double&dash;digit pace, Trademark’s drop-ship, direct to consumer fulfillment and distribution capabilities position the Company as an early adopter and clear market leader.

“During our three-year partnership, Trademark demonstrated exceptional top&dash;line and margin growth, nearly doubling its EBITDA. The ability to bring Blue Point’s China, strategic and value-add planning resources to work alongside this entrepreneurial, local company was key to Blue Point’s investment strategy,” said Sean Ward, a Partner with Blue Point. “We were privileged to support this outstanding team as they continued the Company’s trend as an industry innovator and leader. We are proud of Trademark’s growth and performance, and, of course, pleased with the outcome of our investment.”

Under Blue Point’s ownership, Trademark successfully established an Asia-based office to increase its speed to market time and quality control. Concurrently, this established player in the highly fragmented ecommerce marketplace upgraded to a market-standard IT platform and recreated its inventory management and product development processes, affording the Company with increased operational leverage to continue to scale with the growing ecommerce industry.

“Blue Point was essential to implementing improvements and fostering growth over the last three years, and we benefited greatly from the domestic and international opportunities achieved through our partnership,” said Chief Executive Officer of Trademark, Dan Sustar. “We are grateful for the industry resources and value drivers made available to us and look forward to continuing this momentum with Bertram Capital.”

BB&T Capital Markets served as the exclusive financial advisor to Trademark.
