CHARLOTTE, NC (January 8, 2020) – Blue Point Capital Partners announced today the successful exit of its interest in U.S. Drinks, LLC, a Blue Point II portfolio company.  U.S. Drinks, LLC is the holding company of The Lion Brewery (“Lion”), a producer, packager and distributer of branded and private label specialty beverages located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

The Lion Brewery provides specialized brewing, blending, filling and packaging services for an array of national and regional customers in the non-alcoholic brewed beverage, better-for-you soft drink, energy drink and beer segments. 

During Blue Point’s ownership, EBITDA at Lion nearly doubled.  Blue Point put into place a strong management team, which built out the Company’s canning capabilities, made substantial capital improvements and implemented numerous operational strategies.

“Lion’s location is ideal to serve the densely populated North East, and its consistency in product quality and delivery has afforded the Company with demand that exceeds its current capacity,” said Juli Marley, a Partner with Blue Point.  “We are delighted to see that our support of the business and management team created numerous growth opportunities and positioned Lion to continue to build on and realize optimized results throughout its future.”

Cascadia Capital advised The Lion Brewery on the transaction.
