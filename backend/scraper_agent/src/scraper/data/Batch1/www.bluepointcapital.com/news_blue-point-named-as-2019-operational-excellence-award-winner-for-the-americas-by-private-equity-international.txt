================================================================================
Blue Point Capital Partners has been awarded an Operational Excellence Award by Private Equity International (“PEI”), for creating transformative and sustainable value at Selmet, Inc. (“Selmet”), a leading manufacturer of titanium castings and machined parts for the aerospace industry.  This is the second PEI Operational Excellence Award that Blue Point has received, the first being in 2015 for its successful investment in Area Wide Protective. 

A panel of independent judges, comprised of distinguished scholars and operational experts in the private equity industry, assessed the merits of each submission across the American, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.  Each award recognizes a firm who demonstrated exceptional value creation and highlights the work completed by the private equity team.  

While partnered with Blue Point, Selmet undertook an extensive capital spending program, which allowed it to greatly expand and diversify its machining capabilities.  The Company also identified and closed two add-on acquisitions that further expanded its product offering and geographic footprint.  With these capabilities in place, Blue Point helped Selmet develop a sophisticated sales strategy and team that targeted high-growth, next-generation commercial aerospace & defense programs.  Additionally, Blue Point’s strong ties to industry and operational resources were instrumental in driving Selmet’s overall growth strategy.  During Blue Point’s seven-year hold period, Selmet’s revenues increased substantially and its earnings quadrupled. 

Blue Point sold Selmet to a strategic buyer, Consolidated Precision Products Corp., in August 2018.
