CHARLOTTE, NC / January 23, 2025 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company, National OnDemand (“National”), a leading provider of communication and utility infrastructure services, are excited to announce the acquisition of J. Tucker Construction (“J. Tucker”). The acquisition expands National’s presence in the rapidly growing Texas market, which is facing an increasing demand for fiber and utility infrastructure.

Based in Greenville, Texas, J. Tucker has served major telecom and internet service providers since its founding in 1991. Led by Jason and Tammy Tucker, J. Tucker has built a strong reputation by providing a wide range of services, including aerial construction, directional boring, trenching, buried service wire placement and fiber optic and copper splicing. The company’s exceptional track record has made it a trusted partner to telecom providers throughout the region.

“From day one, this partnership with National has felt like a natural next step to honor my family’s legacy as we drive continued growth and expand our services, all while maintaining the high-quality work our clients expect,” said J. Tucker Owner Jason Tucker. “National’s strong reputation, experienced management team and entrepreneurial culture make this an exciting opportunity.”

Since partnering with Blue Point in December 2021, National has rapidly expanded both organically and through strategic acquisitions. The acquisition of J. Tucker is its third in three years and positions the platform for continued growth. The company plans to capitalize on the rising demand for telecommunications infrastructure while enhancing National’s service offerings and geographic reach.

“We are excited to continue expanding our presence in the Texas market, an area with significant growth potential and a critical need for infrastructure services, especially fiber builds,” said National CEO Douglas Boteler. “We remain focused on strategic growth and are confident that our partnership with J. Tucker will strengthen our ability to deliver streamlined and effective solutions to our customers.”

“Partnering with the Tucker family is an honor, and we are excited to build upon the outstanding business they’ve established over the last 34 years,” said Blue Point Partner Brian Castleberry. “This acquisition highlights National’s strategic efforts to expand its geographic reach and service capabilities.”
