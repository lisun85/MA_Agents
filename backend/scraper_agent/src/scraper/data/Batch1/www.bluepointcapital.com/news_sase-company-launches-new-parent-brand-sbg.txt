CLEVELAND / June 27, 2023 / SASE Company announced today the launch of their new holding company brand, SBG Holdings, Inc. (“SBG”). This formation results from the platform’s organic growth and multiple strategic acquisitions, which have significantly expanded the Company’s core end markets, sales channels and product offering.


“From the outset, our focus with Blue Point was to strategically expand our product and service offering to best serve an ever-growing base of customers across a multitude of channels and end markets,” said SBG’s CEO Karl Moritz. “Having successfully brought SASE’s direct-to-contractor brand and Bartell Global’s distribution channel brand together, we’re benefitting from economies of scale as an industry leader while maintaining the integrity of our highly respected brands in the market.”

SBG Holdings, Inc. will continue to provide consumables and associated equipment for the ongoing maintenance, conversion and placement of concrete flooring and other hardscapes through its industry-leading brands of SASE and Bartell Global.

"As our capabilities and market footprint have grown dramatically in recent years, it is the perfect time to establish a holding company brand that aligns with what the platform has become. There will continue to be compelling organic and acquisitive opportunities to welcome new brands and products to the SBG platform," said Blue Point Partner Brian Castleberry.

SASE directly serves surface preparation and concrete polishing contractors with a comprehensive offering of consumables, equipment, and related solutions.
