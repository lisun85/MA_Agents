CLEVELAND / October 8, 2024 / Blue Point Capital Partners is pleased to announce the recapitalization of Pinnacle MEP Holdings, an HVAC and plumbing services provider with operations throughout the Midwest.

Pinnacle provides an array of mechanical and plumbing services primarily to commercial customers while offering something its corporate competitors cannot — a committed, local presence. The company brings decades of local market experience and exceptional operational resources to the platform, with a focus on strengthening its community-based trade services and fostering long-term customer relationships.

“Blue Point’s impressive track record of transforming companies with similar business models coupled with a legacy of partnering with family- and founder-owned businesses and our synonymous cultural alignment made them a standout partner of choice,” said Pinnacle Co-Founder and CEO Andy Reed. “Blue Point’s approach resonated with us as we both pursue partnerships with market leaders in areas where relationships are critical. We look forward to expanding our operations with their support.”

Pinnacle has completed 15 acquisitions within the last four years, creating a market-leading portfolio across Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Looking forward, Blue Point aims to enhance Pinnacle’s capabilities and scale by leveraging the firm’s deep experience in the business services sector with the support of its extensive operating resources.

“Pinnacle’s experienced leadership team and operators have created an exceptional HVAC and plumbing platform through strategic investments in systems and resources to support growth while maintaining its commitment to its customers, employees and communities,” shared Blue Point Principal Evan Cottington. “We vetted dozens of companies in our effort to expand our business services footprint with an MEP focus, and we could not be more excited to partner with the Pinnacle team to continue its evolution.”

Pinnacle is actively seeking complementary partnerships with like-minded market leaders in HVAC and plumbing services. Business owners interested in learning more may contact Blue Point Managing Director, Business Development Megan Kneipp.




Pinnacle MEP Holdings is a portfolio of companies providing HVACR, plumbing and related mechanical services with a vision for every community to be served by reliable and trustworthy trades within the industry. Comprised of operators and entrepreneurs who know how challenging it can be to run a successful business, Pinnacle is equipped with the resources to help them grow effectively and do more for the people who rely on them.

Blue Point Capital Partners is a private equity firm managing over $1.8 billion in committed capital.
