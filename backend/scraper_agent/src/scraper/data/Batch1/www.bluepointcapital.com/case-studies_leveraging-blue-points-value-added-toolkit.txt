Leveraging Blue Point’s Value-Added Resources




Our collaborative partnership with Transtar includes optimizing their supply chain, speeding the development of leading data and e-commerce capabilities and executing and integrating acquisitions.

Global Supply Chain – Blue Point's global supply chain resources support Transtar Management as they add new product categories, further diversify their supplier base, improve contract terms and reduce freight costs.
Data & Digital – We helped the Company drive adoption of transend, the Company’s proprietary platform designed to address the inadequacies of current industry e-commerce and online ordering systems. We’ve made multiple key hires while optimizing the site and marketing capabilities to support continued growth of online sales.
M&A – We supported the identification, diligence and execution of the acquisition of Pro Form Products and C&M Auto Parts. Both were completed in the first quarter of 2023 and expand Transtar’s product offering and provide access to new sales channels.
