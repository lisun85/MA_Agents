CHARLOTTE, N.C. / May 24, 2022 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its BPCP IV communication and utility infrastructure services company, National OnDemand, are pleased to announce the additions of Unified Utility Alliance, a cable and fiber construction company, and J&S Communications, a provider of cable and fiber last mile services.

National OnDemand partnered with Blue Point in December 2021 and has quickly made significant strides with organic and acquisitive growth.

“These acquisitions accelerate National OnDemand’s geographic and service offering expansion and augment its team and capabilities as a premier provider of infrastructure services in the U.S.,” said Blue Point Partner Brian Castleberry.

Since 2016, Unified Utility Alliance has provided enhanced cable and fiber construction and installation to the Southeastern United States, specializing in aerial and underground construction.

“We have crew members with the talent to be foremen on their own projects, and with the support from National OnDemand, they are going to have that opportunity,” said UUA Co-Founder Greg Henson. “We are looking forward to helping National OnDemand continue its mission in becoming one of the largest service providers in the United States.”

J&S is a cable and fiber installation provider that focuses on providing superior technology integration and high-touch customer service. Cox Communications ranked J&S as one of the top providers in the nation.

“I believe this acquisition is going to significantly enhance our ability to attract and retain technicians as National OnDemand is able to provide additional benefits and career opportunities,” said J&S CEO John Walsh. “Undoubtedly, we are creating a better future for our team members and staff through this acquisition. We look forward to continuing to perform at peak levels, while being a major player in enabling National OnDemand’s strategic objectives.”

“The support and assistance from Blue Point have allowed us to continue our unyielding commitment to growth,” said National OnDemand CEO Douglas Boteler. “We are thrilled with the strength and momentum of the combined teams and view these acquisitions as critical partnerships in our nationwide expansion efforts.”
