CLEVELAND / May 18, 2021 / Blue Point Capital Partners (“Blue Point”) and its Blue Point III portfolio company, Sylvan Group (“Sylvan”), announced today the acquisition of Great Lakes Mechanical (“GLM”). Combining Sylvan and GLM (together, the “Company”) positions the organization for significant growth as a major player in the industrial and commercial contracting industries throughout the Eastern U.S. and Canada.

The acquisition enables the Company to accelerate customer growth by serving as a one-stop-shop for innovative, sustainable and quality industrial and commercial building solutions. Leveraging GLM’s commercial and service capabilities alongside Sylvan’s industrial contracting expertise and geographic reach, the Company will deliver a full line of industrial/mechanical service solutions for its clients.

“We have enjoyed a positive working relationship with GLM for many years and have seen firsthand the high-quality work and excellent customer service the team provides,” said Sylvan CEO Robert Metz. “We are thrilled to formally welcome GLM to the Sylvan family.”

“We couldn’t have found better stewards for the future of our family business than the Blue Point and Sylvan teams. They bring not only industry expertise that will help the Company continue to grow, but also the perfect cultural fit to take care of our employees and customers,” said GLM President Mark Perpich.

“The addition of GLM aligns perfectly with our ongoing growth strategy for Sylvan,” said Blue Point Partner Jonathan Pressnell. “In parallel with our investments in the Company’s organic growth, we plan to make further strategic acquisitions of culturally compatible companies that can expand service offerings, end markets and geographies served­—just as GLM will.”
