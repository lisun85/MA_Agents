Blue Point is thrilled to share that we were named Lower Mid-Market Firm of the Year at Global M&A Network’s M&A Atlas Awards. Adding to the celebration — our 2023 acquisition of Europa Eyewear was also chosen as the USA Private Equity Deal of the Year, making it the second consecutive year Blue Point has been recognized for its transaction accomplishments.

Blue Point Partner John LeMay and Principal Evan Cottington proudly represented the firm at the January 30th ceremony, which “honors the achievements of outstanding firms and best value-creating transactions.”

We are grateful to be recognized along with many other incredible firms and dealmakers. Thank you to our team and trusted partners for all that you do!
