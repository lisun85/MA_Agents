Global Supply Chain Strategies


Blue Point’s efforts to expand OrthoLite’s manufacturing and international sourcing allowed the Company to successfully accommodate its rapid growth. OrthoLite grew from one facility in each of China and Vietnam to four in China, two in Vietnam, a joint venture in Indonesia and the initial formation of a joint venture in India in just 3.5 years. During this time, OrthoLite also completed the construction of a second foaming facility and developed a sophisticated capacity utilization model – both of which supported significant revenue growth. Blue Point and OrthoLite’s management team aimed to accommodate growth while increasing customer service and touchpoints to strengthen customer loyalty.

Human Capital

During Blue Point’s hold, OrthoLite deepened its management team by filling several C-suite positions and hiring middle management positions across all key functional areas. The Company also established a robust Sales & Marketing department to help diversify its customer base. Blue Point and the OrthoLite management team focused on improving its manufacturing, purchasing, subcontracting and logistics functions in addition to developing monthly management KPIs to effectively measure performance.
