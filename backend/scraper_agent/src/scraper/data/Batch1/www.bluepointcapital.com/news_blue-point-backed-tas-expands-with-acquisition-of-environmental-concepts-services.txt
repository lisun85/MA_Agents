ECS marks TAS’ fifth acquisition since partnering with Blue Point in May of 2019. With Blue Point’s support, the TAS team will continue to broaden its attractive waste management capabilities and pursue additional well-aligned opportunities.

“This partnership is a continuation of the value creation strategy the Blue Point and TAS teams committed to from the outset — to expand the platform’s footprint and capabilities through strategic M&A and organic value creation while preserving its commitment to excellent service,” said Blue Point Partner Charley Geiger. “We are honored to work alongside the TAS and ECS teams to assist in fostering their ongoing success.”
