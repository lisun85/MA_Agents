CHARLOTTE / March 16, 2023 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company, Transtar Holding Company, are pleased to announce the acquisition of C&M Auto Parts, a family-owned wholesale supplier of truck and automotive parts with a focus on undercar and underhood products.


Based in Trenton, New Jersey, C&M services independent, regional and national repair shops, dealerships, government agencies and fleets throughout Central New Jersey. C&M is a member of The National Pronto Association and brings preferred supplier buying programs, valuable nationwide warranty programs for customers and other support advantages.

“As we got to know the Transtar team, it became clear that our teams are well-aligned in our values, commitment to growth and dedication to serving our customers,” said C&M Founder Glenn Morreale, who will join Transtar’s executive leadership team.

Transtar CEO Neil Sethi added, “C&M’s full-line product offering, deep supplier relationships and operational experience will be powerful drivers as we look to further expand our footprint in the general automotive repair channel.”

Transtar is a portfolio of automotive aftermarket brands with business units focused on parts distribution, cutting-edge e-commerce, software, coatings products and more. C&M represents Transtar’s second acquisition in 2023 — the Company recently acquired Pro Form Products, a manufacturer of refinishing and repair products for automotive, aviation, industrial and marine applications.

“The addition of C&M demonstrates Transtar’s commitment to deepening its experience in the professional installer segment, as well as the team’s ongoing dedication to its values and customer service,” said Blue Point Partner Brian Castleberry. “Likewise, Blue Point is committed to providing the full Transtar portfolio of companies the resources needed to grow, and strategic M&A and successful integration will continue to be a key component of our strategy.”
