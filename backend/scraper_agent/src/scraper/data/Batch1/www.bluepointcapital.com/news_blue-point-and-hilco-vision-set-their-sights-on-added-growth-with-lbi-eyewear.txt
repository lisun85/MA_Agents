CLEVELAND, OH (May 23, 2017) – Blue Point Capital Partners and its Blue Point III portfolio company, Hilco Vision, announced the acquisition of the cases and accessories division of LBI Eyewear, a leading distributor of frames, cases and accessories, headquartered in California with operations in Las Vegas, Nevada.

This transaction represents the sixth add-on acquisition for Hilco since Blue Point acquired the platform investment in May 2014, and the second acquisition for Hilco in 2017.

“LBI is a strong player that adds valuable product scale, particularly within cases, to Hilco Vision.  While partnered with Blue Point, Hilco has continued its focus on identifying and pursuing complementary categories and operating scale to position the Company for continued growth,” said Jonathan Pressnell, a Principal with Blue Point. 

Ross Brownlee, Chief Executive Officer of Hilco Vision said, "We have long been impressed by LBI’s capabilities and loyal customer base built for its cases and accessories programs.  The consumer accessories category is increasingly important to Hilco Vision as we seek to simplify the buying experience for our customers.  We are excited to expand LBI’s reach and leverage our digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience.”

“We strongly believe that partnering with Hilco Vision will bring a significant value proposition to our customers and strengthen what we have built over the last 68 years,” said Chett Lehrer, co-owner of LBI Eyewear.  “We pride ourselves on an exceptional product and customer focus, and Hilco Vision will help to continue that mission.”
