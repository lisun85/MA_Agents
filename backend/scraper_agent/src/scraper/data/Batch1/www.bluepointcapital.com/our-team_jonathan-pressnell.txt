Prior to joining Blue Point in 2007, Jonathan worked as an analyst for KeyBanc Capital Markets in the mergers and acquisitions group, and he began his career as an auditor at EY.

Jonathan holds a B.S.B.A. in Accounting from the University of Pittsburgh, an M.S. in Accountancy from the University of Notre Dame and an M.B.A. from the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College, where he was an Edward Tuck Scholar.
