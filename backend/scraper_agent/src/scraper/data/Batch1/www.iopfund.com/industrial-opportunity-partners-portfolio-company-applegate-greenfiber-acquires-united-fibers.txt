INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITY PARTNERS’ PORTFOLIO COMPANY APPLEGATE GREENFIBER ACQUIRES UNITED FIBERS

Evanston, Ill., January 12, 2023 – Operations-focused private equity firm Industrial Opportunity Partners, LLC (“IOP”) today announced that its existing portfolio company Applegate Greenfiber Holdings LLC (“Applegate Greenfiber”) has acquired the assets of United Fibers, which operates a materials recovery facility (“MRF”) and cellulose insulation plant in Chandler, Ariz. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Applegate Greenfiber, formed by IOP in 2021, is the largest manufacturer of cellulose insulation in the North American market. The acquisition of United Fibers provides Applegate Greenfiber with expanded production capabilities to support its growth in providing environmentally preferred and safe cellulose insulation to both residential and commercial markets across the Southwest. In addition to its robust thermal, acoustic, fire, and air insulation properties, cellulose insulation is a carbon negative, sustainable product that is made primarily from recycled materials, does not require harsh chemicals to produce, and contributes towards lower energy usage.

Andy Weller, the Chairman of Applegate Greenfiber and IOP Operating Principal, commented that “We are pleased to add United Fibers’ integrated MRF and cellulose production facility to our network to support our customers. United Fibers’ excellent operations, capacity, and geographic footprint make this an impactful acquisition for Applegate Greenfiber.”

Applegate Greenfiber President and CEO, Tom VanAlstine, said, “We feel very privileged to add the United Fibers operation to our portfolio, allowing us to better service our customers in the Southwest and continue to expand the presence of cellulose within the insulation industry.”
