Evanston, Ill., May 14, 2024 – Industrial Opportunity Partners (“IOP”), an operations-focused private equity firm based in Evanston, Ill., today announced that newly formed IBP Solutions, Inc. has acquired Masonite Architectural (“Masonite Architectural” or the “Company”), the commercial wood door business segment of Masonite International Corporation (“Masonite”), a recently acquired business unit of Owens Corning (NYSE: OC).

Masonite Architectural supplies built-to-order wood doors to a broad range of customers for use in commercial and institutional settings including hospitality, healthcare, education, and office, among others. The Company operates 13 facilities in eight states and Canada with a total operating footprint of 1.7 million square feet.

Mr. Ninneman is a member of IOP’s Board of Operating Principals which is comprised of experienced executives who provide leadership to the businesses in which IOP invests. Mr. Ninneman said, “We have been impressed with Masonite Architectural’s strong foundation – an excellent product portfolio, vertically integrated production capacity, and advanced quick ship capabilities. We will further leverage those assets as a focused, standalone business serving the Company’s diverse customer base.”

We believe IOP’s prior experience in the commercial wood door segment will favorably impact the Company’s customers and employees and we look forward to utilizing IOP’s operational resources to help the Company achieve its full potential.”
