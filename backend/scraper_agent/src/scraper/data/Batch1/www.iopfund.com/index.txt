BESIDE YOU ON THE SHOP FLOOR

Based in Evanston, Illinois, IOP was founded in 2005 by a group of like-minded finance and operations executives who came together to build a private equity firm centered on a shared passion for the companies that are the backbone of our economy — middle-market manufacturing and distribution businesses. We use a collaborative model for investing in and working with these companies to create value for all constituencies — employees, communities, customers, suppliers and investors.

IOP has raised more than $1.5 billion in committed capital from endowments, pension funds and other institutions. We’ve invested in 25+ middle-market industrial platform companies over our history.
