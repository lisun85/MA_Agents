ANDY WELLER

Operating Principal

> WITH IOP SINCE 2006

Andy has over 30 years of experience in all aspects of operations, finance, M&A and management leadership.

At IOP, Andy has served as chairman of Monroe Truck Equipment, AAA Sales & Engineering, Aarrowcast, KIC, Roadtrek and Center Manufacturing, and has been a board member at SRR Holdings, Union Corrugating, Kuss Filtration, Gulfco and Carlson Systems.

Andy began his career at Bethlehem Steel Corporation, where he held a variety of finance and tax positions, ultimately serving as Vice President of Finance. In 1994, Andy joined Johnstown America Industries, Inc. (JAI), a manufacturer of railroad freight cars, as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director. At the time, JAI was a publicly traded company managed by TMB Industries, where Andy was a Senior Managing Director and Partner.

In 1999, JAI divested the railroad freight car business and changed its name to Transportation Technologies Industries, Inc. (TTI) to reflect its exclusive focus on the commercial vehicle market. In early 2000, TMB Industries and Trimaran Capital took TTI private. Andy was promoted to President of TTI and served in that role until TTI’s acquisition by Accuride Corporation (a KKR portfolio company), another manufacturer of components for commercial vehicles, in January 2005. The combined company was then taken public (NYSE: ACW) with Andy serving as Executive Vice President and Director, leading the integration of the two companies. In December 2005, he completed the integration of the businesses and ended his role at Accuride.

Andy graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in Business Administration, and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University.
