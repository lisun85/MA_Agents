Xpress Wellness Expands Geographic Footprint
DALLAS, TX
APRIL 28, 2022

Latticework Capital Management’s (“LCM”) rural health and urgent care platform, Xpress Wellness (“Xpress”) has partnered with Integrity Urgent Care (“Integrity”).

Founded in 2017 by Dr. Eddy Dark, Integrity operates ten urgent care clinics in rural Central Texas. The addition of Integrity to Xpress’ platform expands its geographic presence, now 43 clinics across three states, and adds significant clinical and operational leadership to assist with Xpress’ continued growth.

“We are very excited to add Integrity’s clinics and leadership team to the Xpress platform,” said Grant Asay, CEO of Xpress. “Integrity’s mission to provide high quality healthcare to individuals in rural communities aligns perfectly with Xpress’ values and we look forward to working with Dr. Dark and the rest of the Integrity team.”

“Our partnership with Xpress provides additional resources to help us serve patients in our communities,” said Dr. Eddy Dark, Integrity Founder and CEO. “We look forward to working with the Xpress team to continue serving our existing communities and to also expand access to care in rural Texas via future clinic openings.”

“We are excited to complete our second add-on acquisition for the Xpress platform. Throughout its history, Xpress has provided exceptional care to patients in its 30+ communities throughout Oklahoma and Kansas,” said Kyle Bradford, LCM Managing Partner. “We are thrilled to be in Texas and look forward to continue supporting the combined company as it expands its locations and services throughout all three states.”

LCM partnered with Xpress in July of 2018 and is actively seeking additional acquisition opportunities. Please reach out to Grant Asay (g.asay@xpwell.com).
