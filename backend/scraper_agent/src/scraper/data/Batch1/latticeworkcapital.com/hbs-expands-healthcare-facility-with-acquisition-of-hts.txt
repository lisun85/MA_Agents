HBS Expands Healthcare Facility with Acquisition of HTS
DALLAS, TX
JUNE 28, 2022

Latticework Capital Management’s (“LCM”) healthcare consulting platform Healthcare Building Solutions, LLC (“HBS”) has acquired The Transition Planning Division of Healthcare Technical Services, LLC (“HTS”).

Founded in 2002, HTS is a national firm that offers a range of services and solutions to facility managers and owners. This includes transition planning, facility activation, and move planning services to hospitals, which help to ensure a safe transition and patient relocation into a new environment of care.

“We are very excited to add HTS’s deep bench of clinical expertise and transition planning professionals to our service line offerings,” shares Jay Hornung, ACHE, CHFM, President and CEO of HBS. “The addition of HTS to our portfolio of firms provides us with the resources, scale, geographic reach, and capabilities to solidify our position as the leading provider of transition planning and facility activation services in the healthcare industry.”

“We have collaborated with HBS on projects and know that HBS shares our client-first focus,” adds HTS Senior Vice President Hilda Nering, RN, MSN. “We decided to join forces with HBS because we believe that a larger organization will allow us to provide a wider array of services and more depth to meet evolving client needs.”
“We are very excited to partner with the HTS team as we strategically expand the transition planning division of HBS,” said Kyle Bradford, LCM Managing Partner. “This is the second add-on acquisition for the HBS platform in 2022 and we expect several more will follow as we continue to support the management team in our value creation initiatives.”

LCM partnered with HBS in August of 2021 and is actively seeking acquisition opportunities. Please reach out to Jay Hornung (jay.hornung@hbsinc.com).
