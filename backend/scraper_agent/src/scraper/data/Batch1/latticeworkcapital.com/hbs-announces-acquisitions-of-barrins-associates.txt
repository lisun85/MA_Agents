Latticework Capital Management’s (“LCM”) healthcare consulting platform Healthcare Building Solutions, LLC (“HBS”) has acquired Barrins & Associates, a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in accreditation and regulatory compliance consulting for the behavioral healthcare industry.

“We are very excited to add Barrins & Associates’ deep bench of behavioral healthcare expertise to our Accreditation and Regulatory Service Line offerings,” shares Jay Hornung, ACHE, CHFM, President and CEO of HBS. “This acquisition, combined with our acquisition of Patton Healthcare Consulting earlier this year, confirms our status as one of the leading providers of regulatory compliance services in the healthcare industry.”

“We are very excited to partner with the Barrins & Associates team as we strategically expand the regulatory service line of HBS,” said Kyle Bradford, LCM Managing Partner. “This is the third add-on acquisition for the HBS platform in 2022 and we expect several more will follow as we continue to support the management team in our value creation initiatives.”
