Experienced Healthcare Investors

With a focus solely on the healthcare industry, our team has a wealth of experience across various subsectors, including providers, medical equipment, business services, and pharmaceutical services. Since 2015, we have built and scaled companies across the healthcare ecosystem through diverse economic cycles, completing over 141 acquisitions and 44 de novo expansions.

Value Creation Plan

The Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) is created before closing to develop strategic and tactical alignment with management in order to build the company with a shared vision.

Addition of talent to augment leadership (as needed) and fill any gaps in the team structure
Use of Board members and operating partners for strategic and tactical execution
Continual focus on exit strategy
Enhance operations, with emphasis on data driven decision making
Identification of organic growth potential, with a specific focus on deeper penetration of existing customers and geographies, diversification of products and services, expanding sales and marketing, and new geographic expansion
The Mutual Expectations Pact between Latticework Capital Management and the management team establishes a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities post-investment.

We focus on cultivating a strategic board of directors, managing lender relations, overseeing acquisition processes, and planning for exits. The management team handles day-to-day operations, business development, and overall management. Both parties collaborate closely on strategy development, reporting, communication, recruiting, and succession planning. This ongoing partnership includes regular communication with CEOs and CFOs, facility visits, strategic discussions, and comprehensive reporting on key performance indicators, budgeting, and financial forecasting. This collaborative approach ensures alignment and maximizes the potential for shared success.
