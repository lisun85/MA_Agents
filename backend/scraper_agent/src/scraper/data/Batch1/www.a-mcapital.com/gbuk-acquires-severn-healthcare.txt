GBUK Acquires Severn Healthcare

4 September 2024 – GBUK, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired UK-based Severn Healthcare Technologies (“Severn”), a value-added and fast-growing distributor of single-use medical devices.

Founded in 2014, Severn specialises in providing next-generation single-use medical devices across the Ear, Nose, and Throat (“ENT”) and Neuro-Otology clinical specialisms. Supporting the adoption of clinical innovation in operating theatres across the National Health Service (“NHS”) and the UK Private market, we believe Severn has built a reputation as a trusted partner to surgical clinicians on the foundations of deep technical expertise and exceeding customer service. 

The acquisition of Severn represents GBUK’s second acquisition since AMCE’s investment in December 2023. The acquisition is expected to strengthen GBUK’s clinical specialist positioning further while expanding its product presence in two new and innovative therapeutic areas.

GBUK were advised by Rothschild & Co as financial adviser, Burness Paull as legal adviser, Accuracy as accounting adviser, and PMSI as commercial adviser.
