United Musculoskeletal Partners Announces Merger with Novum Orthopedic Partners and Addition of Founding Practice

Atlanta, GA – United Musculoskeletal Partners (UMP) announced today its merger with Dallas-based Novum Orthopedic Partners (Novum), to form the premier physician-owned orthopedic platform in the country. In addition, Denver-based Panorama Orthopedics (Panorama) joins Atlanta-based Resurgens Orthopaedics (Resurgens) and Dallas-based Arlington Orthopedic Associates (AOA) as co-founding partners of UMP. Together, these new partnerships establish UMP as a national leader in musculoskeletal care delivery.

UMP, led by CEO Alex Bateman, is a joint venture of leading orthopedic practices and private equity group Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS). With the addition of Novum and Panorama, UMP grows to nearly 190 physician partners and 320 total providers across Colorado, Georgia and Texas.

Backed by A&M Capital Partners (AMCP), Novum launched its orthopedic platform in December 2021 by bringing together AOA, Abilene Sports Medicine & Orthopedics and Waxahachie Orthopedic and Sports Medicine and investments in two leading surgical facilities captive to those practices. Inclusive of the recent addition of North Texas Orthopedics & Spine Center, the four Novum practices will join UMP, with AMCP joining as go-forward sponsor partners alongside WCAS.

“I believe this partnership of elite orthopedic groups, backed by WCAS and AMCP, will be transformative, as we come together to deliver the very best patient care and drive innovation and growth,” said Bateman. “This merger will allow UMP to continue adding like-minded practices to our footprint, as we build the leading musculoskeletal enterprise in the nation.”

Eric Slimmer, Chief Development Officer for Novum said, “The timing was serendipitous that we could merge these two newly formed ventures into one, high-performing platform. Our visions are aligned and that favorably positions us to execute on our goals together.”

“This partnership is especially exciting for Panorama as we join forces with Novum, Resurgens, WCAS and AMCP under the UMP platform to create more access for patients to world-class orthopedic and musculoskeletal care,” said Mark Conklin, MD, President of Panorama. “Together, we can continue paving the way for the future of orthopedics.”
