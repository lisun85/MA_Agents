Carton Pack Acquires Fimat

17 December 2024 – Carton Pack, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired Italy-headquartered Fimat S.p.A. (“Fimat” or the “Company”), a leading provider of paper & carton food packaging solutions.

Founded in 1933 and headquartered in the province of Milan, Northern Italy, Fimat is a renowned player in the folding carton industry, with a particular expertise in the fruit & vegetable (“F&V”) and other food end-markets, including bakery and snacks. The Company maintains a robust presence in the F&V end-markets across Northern Italy, France and Germany. The founding Fornaroli family will retain a minority stake in the Company, ensuring continuity.

We believe this acquisition represents a further positive milestone in Carton Pack’s strategy to become a leading European food packaging specialist. It strengthens its footprint in paper & carton packaging, reinforces its F&V end-market focus and expands Carton Pack into the attractive Northern Italian market, as well as France and Germany. The transaction is Carton Pack’s fourth add-on acquisition since AMCE acquired a majority stake in April 2022 and AMCE’s 26th Fund I transaction.

Alpeggiani Avvocati Associati advised Carton Pack as legal counsel for M&A and corporate matters, Spada Partners as accounting and tax advisers and Ramboll as environmental adviser.
