Ayesa Acquires M2C

28 April 2022 – Ayesa, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based middle- market private equity firm with €650 million of assets under management, has acquired M2C, a Spanish provider of IT services specialised in data management and process automation solutions.

Founded in 2004, M2C offers a comprehensive portfolio of digital transformation solutions in big data and analytics, business process management, and systems administration. M2C employs 255 professionals and serves clients primarily in the insurance, banking, and telecom sectors.

The acquisition of M2C represents a key milestone in Ayesa’s plans to consolidate the fragmented IT services market in Spain, drive growth in emerging technology verticals and diversify its end-market exposure. Following the recent acquisition of Byrne Looby, M2C represents Ayesa’s second add-on acquisition since AMCE’s investment in January 2022.

AMCE and Ayesa were advised by Arcano as a financial adviser, Roland Berger as a commercial adviser, EY as an accounting adviser and Pérez-Llorca as a legal adviser. Alvarez & Marsal advised on operational due diligence and integration.
