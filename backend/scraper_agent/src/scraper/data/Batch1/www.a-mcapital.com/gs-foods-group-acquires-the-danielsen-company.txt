Founded in 1964 by Jim Danielsen (“Big Jim”) and his wife Janice, The Danielsen Company has been an integral part of the Northern California foodservice industry for more than 60 years. The company, which serves a wide array of customers including K-12 schools, has built its reputation on the principles of honesty, integrity and customer service.

“We were looking for longevity in a partner dedicated to school nutrition and are thrilled to join forces with a company like GS Foods,” said Terri Danielsen, CEO of The Danielsen Company. “By combining our long-term relationships with GS Foods’ unparalleled capabilities, this partnership will ensure that our legacy of outstanding service and commitment to the community lives on.”

As part of the integration, Danielsen’s leadership and staff will continue to work closely with GS Foods to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain the company’s strong relationships with customers across Northern California.

“GS Foods continues to strengthen its food distribution network, always prioritizing customer service and product excellence,” said Steve Russell, Managing Director and Sr. Portfolio Manager of Highview. “This partnership between The Danielsen Company and GS Foods will enable us to continue providing dedicated support to school districts in Northern California, all while fostering a crucial national nutrition supply network.”

“The acquisition of The Danielsen Company allows GS Foods to continue expanding its geographic presence as a leading food distributor for K-12,” said Jack McCarthy, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of A&M Capital. “When partnering with other companies, it’s imperative that we’re aligned on core values and the commitment to top-tier service.
