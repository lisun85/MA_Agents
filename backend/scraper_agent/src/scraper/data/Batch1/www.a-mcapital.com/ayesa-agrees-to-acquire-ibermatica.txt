Ayesa Agrees to Acquire Ibermática

Acquisition Will Nearly Double Revenue of Combined Group to Over €600 Million

Ayesa, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), has agreed to acquire Ibermática, a leading Spanish IT services company, from ProA Capital and the remaining minority shareholders, including ONCE and Kutxabank.

The transaction is expected to close before year-end, following approval by the relevant authorities. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Founded in 1973, Ibermática (“IB”) is one of the leading IT services providers for large corporates in Spain and counts many IBEX 35 companies as clients. IB offers a wide-ranging portfolio of solutions spanning IT consultancy, cybersecurity, cloud computing and data analytics. At the end of 2021, IB had approximately 4,750 employees and revenue of €276 million.

Through this transaction, we believe Ayesa will be able to consolidate its position in the Spanish IT services market, becoming one of Spain’s foremost service providers. The combined group will employ over 11,000 professionals worldwide, generate more than €600m in revenue, and benefit from enhanced technological capabilities, broad and complimentary sector coverage, a deeper nationwide presence, and a reinforced international footprint.

Following the recent acquisitions of Byrne Looby in Ireland and M2C in Spain, IB constitutes Ayesa’s third add-on acquisition since AMCE’s majority investment in January 2022.

Arcano acted as financial advisor to AMCE and Ayesa, BCG as a commercial adviser, Alvarez & Marsal as an operational adviser, EY as an accounting adviser, Houlihan Lokey as a debt adviser, and Pérez-Llorca and Weil, Gotshal & Manges as legal advisers.
