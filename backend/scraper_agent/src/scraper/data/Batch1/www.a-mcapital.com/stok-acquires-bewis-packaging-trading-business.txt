STOK Acquires BEWI’s packaging trading business

30 October 2024 – STOK, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has entered into a binding agreement to carveout BEWI’s trading business (“BEWI Food”), a leading distributor of food packaging in Norway and Iceland. BEWI will reinvest a proportion of its proceeds in the combined company. The acquisition of BEWI Food represents STOK’s first add-on since AMCE’s investment, less than six months after closing in April 2024.

We believe BEWI Food is a highly regarded and trusted supplier of food packaging in Norway and Iceland, with a particularly solid position in the fish and seafood market. The company expects to generate sales of more than €70m in 2024. We believe BEWI Food is a complementary combination with STOK, which together creates a leading packaging distributor in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland and allows both STOK and BEWI to improve their customer oﬀering by broadening their product range and providing more comprehensive solutions to customers’ packaging needs. The combined group is expected to have annual sales of approximately €190 million for 2024 and a clear strategy for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions.

STOK and AMCE were advised by Schjødt as legal adviser, EY as tax adviser, PwC as accounting adviser, West Monroe as IT adviser, ERM as environmental advisor and Alvarez & Marsal as operational adviser.
