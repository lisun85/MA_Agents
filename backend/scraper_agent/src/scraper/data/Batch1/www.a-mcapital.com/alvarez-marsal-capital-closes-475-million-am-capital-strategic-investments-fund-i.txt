Alvarez & Marsal Capital Closes ~$475 Million A&M Capital Strategic Investments Fund I

Greenwich, CT | April 9, 2024 – Alvarez & Marsal Capital (“A&M Capital” or “AMC”) , a multi-strategy private equity investment firm with ~$5.9 billion in commitments to funds and accounts under management across six funds and four investment strategies, announced that its fourth and most recent strategy launched in June 2021, A&M Capital Strategic Investments (“AMCSI” or the “Fund”), successfully held its final closing at ~$475 million on March 1, 2024. Taken together, AMCSI total commitments across funds and managed accounts on behalf of substantial LPs aggregate to more than $635 million. AMC has a strategic association with Alvarez and Marsal (“A&M”), one of the largest operationally focused consulting firms in the world.

The closing of AMCSI is expected to enable AMC to continue pursuing attractive investments in middle-market companies alongside premier private equity firms in their core areas of expertise. AMC believes AMCSI is a unique and sought out minority investor given the value it can bring to its strategic association with A&M.

AMCSI has a team of six investment professionals based in the New York City / Greenwich, CT area. The Fund is broadly sector agnostic, targeting minority ownership stakes in North American and Western European middle-market companies with transaction values of less than $1 billion. To date, AMCSI has completed eight investments alongside eight different lead private equity firms across a diversified range of industries.

The Fund attracted a balanced and strong investor base. In addition to A&M senior advisors, who in aggregate represent the largest commitment, the fundraising saw strong demand from their party institutions, including existing investors from AMC’s diverse network and investors new to A&M Capital. The institutional investors include pension funds, insurance companies, “fund-of-funds”, endowments, and family offices.

“We are extremely pleased with the formation of A&M Capital Strategic Investments and are fortunate to count some of the largest and most sophisticated private equity investors from around the world as our partners in this new and compelling strategy”, said Mike Odrich, Managing Partner & Co-Founder of A&M Capital. “We believe AMCSI Fund I provides us with the capital we need to execute our active minority stake investment strategy throughout the economic cycle and middle-market landscape. Leveraging our relationships with Alvarez & Marsal’s consulting business for both deal sourcing and value creation, we expect to continue to create benefits with our high-quality GP partners across a strong, diversified portfolio”, added Jack McCarthy, Managing Partner & Co-Founder of A&M Capital. Commenting on the final close, Rob Redmond, Managing Partner of A&M Capital Strategic Investments, said, “We are very pleased to have closed our first fund and are grateful for the strong support demonstrated by our partners in their commitment to our strategy. As we progressed in our fundraising, we experienced strong acceleration in the volume of very attractive investment opportunities, allowing us to remain selective in adding new companies to our existing portfolio. We believe that our strategic relationship with Alvarez & Marsal’s advisory business will continue to propel our efforts to be the firm of choice for leading mid-market GPs in accessing value added capital for their transactions.”
