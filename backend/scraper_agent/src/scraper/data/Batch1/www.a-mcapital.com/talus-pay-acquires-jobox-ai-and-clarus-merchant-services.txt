Jobox utilizes a modular, open-source architecture that Talus Pay plans to scale across core industry verticals beyond home services through Talus Pay direct and reseller channels including ISV partners.

“Jobox is a terrific tool for underserved home and facility services professionals to help them efficiently run their businesses and increase their bottom lines,” said Shay Bloch, co-founder and CEO of Jobox.“By joining forces with Talus Pay, we can accelerate our market share in the home services end market while having the opportunity to accelerate entry into new market verticals.”

Clarus has deep and trusted expertise in a wide range of business-to-business verticals, credit unions, wholesale distribution groups, and building materials distribution companies. The company offers unmatched customer care, competitive pricing and the highest level of cardholder security.

“We have significant portfolio and business synergies with Talus Pay which makes joining forces natural,” said Eric Pottebaum, president of Clarus.“We are excited to be able to offer our merchant customers new and innovative solutions from Talus Pay, and to combine forces to help drive long-term growth.”
