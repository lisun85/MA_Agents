Empress Ambulance Service closed a deal acquiring certain assets of Mobile Life Support Services, Inc. (“Mobile Life”) on June 14, 2023. This transaction follows closely Empress’s acquisition of certain assets of Rockland Mobile Care (a division of Rockland Paramedics Services), which took place on April 30, 2023.

Mobile Life is a privately owned commercial ambulance service started by Gayle Metzger and her late husband, Rick, in 1981. Since then, the company, which provides 911 ambulance service to many of the municipalities in the Hudson Valley area of New York State, has grown to nearly 300 EMS professionals with a fleet of over 65 emergency vehicles.

Rockland Mobile Care was the non-emergency ambulance division of Rockland Paramedic Services. Started in 1999 in response to a need for quality ambulance transportation between healthcare facilities in an efficient and professional manner, Rockland Mobile Care will remain a critical part of the continuum of patient care with Empress.

Empress, a PatientCare EMS Solutions (“PatientCare”) company, with over 800 staff and 130 emergency vehicles prior to these additions, provides emergency and non-emergency ambulance services to municipalities and hospital systems in New York’s Westchester County, the Bronx and Manhattan boroughs, and has a significant existing presence in the Hudson Valley region. In addition to its primary ambulance services, Empress offers a mobile integrated health (MIH) service providing on-site care to patients who do not need to be transported to the hospital.

“We are excited to continue to grow our company. The acquisition of certain assets of Mobile Life and Rockland Mobile Care give us the opportunity to strengthen our relationships with current clients and provide the people and resources to meet their increasing needs. Our intention is to minimize any operational disruption and to ensure consistent quality service for the communities these companies serve,” said Michael Minerva, president of Empress. “These transactions support our mission to be the provider of choice for hospital networks and other facilities in the greater New York Area.”

As part of the larger PatientCare family of companies which has operations in Florida, South Dakota, Texas and New York, Empress will have the ability to expand critical services and offer mobile healthcare programs throughout the service areas.

“Acquiring these assets is aligned with our corporate strategic growth goal of expansion in the area,” said Herman Schwarz, CEO of PatientCare. “We are already immersed in these markets and are excited to be able to provide further support to our current customers, as well as expand our customer base, through these transactions.”
