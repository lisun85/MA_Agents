Novum Orthopedic Partners Expands Its Physician Practice Management Platform in Dallas-Fort Worth with Investment in North Texas Orthopedics & Spine Center

The new partnership represents a continuum of Novum’s strategy to build a network of like-minded, entrepreneurial orthopedic practices and surgery centers in Texas and across the U.S.

DALLAS ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­– Novum Orthopedic Partners (Novum), a leader in orthopedics and spine practice management, has made a strategic investment in Dallas-Fort Worth-based North Texas Orthopedics & Spine Center (NTO), one of the regions most respected orthopedic practices. NTO delivers a full suite of musculoskeletal services, including orthopedic consultation, surgeries, pain management, diagnostic imaging, and physical therapy through an integrated care network. 

“Novum’s footprint in the Dallas-Fort Worth region is rapidly growing, and we see an opportunity to operationalize our practice in a way that delivers more value to our patients, physicians, and leadership team,” said Lora Fulmer, Chief Executive Officer at NTO. “By joining Novum, we expect to streamline burdensome administrative tasks for our staff, especially in areas such as billing and compliance, while providing our physicians with real-time operational and clinical benchmarks to improve patient outcomes and overall practice performance.”

“Novum’s ability to deliver value to practice providers and improve the patient experience are just two reasons we joined the Novum team,” added Dr. Michael Briseño, President and Spine Surgeon at NTO. “Our physician group is excited to enter into this new era of medicine while partnering with Novum and their growing bench of outstanding orthopedic providers and support networks.”

The investments are a continuum of Novum’s strategy to partner with like-minded, entrepreneurial orthopedic practices across the U.S. The model provides practice partners with a full suite of technology-enabled compliance, revenue cycle and financial services that can improve operational efficiency and empower physicians to deliver best-in-class clinical care. With the closing of NTO, Novum has expanded its practice management platform to include 47 orthopedic and spine physician partners and more than 400 employees across 10 practice locations, 3 affiliated surgical facilities and 10 physical therapy sites in Texas.

“We’ve developed an attractive, fast-growing model centered around delivering technology-enabled infrastructure and outstanding personnel,” said Eric Slimmer, Novum’s Chief Development Officer. “The model empowers independent orthopedic practices to remain locally managed and physician-led while equipping them with data-driven solutions that create a better experience for patients and physicians.”

“We are excited to welcome the NTO team to the Novum partnership,” said Alex Sacripanti, Vice President at AMCP. “NTO’s commitment to best-in-class clinical quality, together with Novum’s access to resources and our capital investment, creates a powerful partnership to grow and expand Novum in the highly attractive Texas market. We are thrilled to partner with their team of providers.”
