Ayesa Acquires Emergya Group

4 June 2024 – Ayesa, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired Emergya Group, a fast-growing Spanish provider of digital transformation services specialised in Google Cloud technologies.

Founded in 2003, Emergya Group operates two independent divisions, Emergya and Proxya. Emergya develops cutting-edge data and artificial intelligence solutions, such as conversational AI, location intelligence, and cloud-native apps. Proxya provides software development, evolutive app maintenance, and digital workplace solutions. Emergya Group employs 680 professionals and serves clients primarily in the technology, consumer, and public administration sectors.

The acquisition of Emergya Group is expected to strengthen Ayesa’s leading position in the Spanish IT services market and expand Ayesa’s capabilities in emerging technology verticals. Following a period of significant M&A activity that included the acquisitions of Byrne Looby, M2C and Ibermática, among others, Emergya Group represents Ayesa’s sixth acquisition since AMCE’s investment in January 2022.

AMCE and Ayesa were advised by Arcano as financial advisers, Pérez-Llorca as legal and tax advisers, and Alvarez & Marsal as accounting advisers.
