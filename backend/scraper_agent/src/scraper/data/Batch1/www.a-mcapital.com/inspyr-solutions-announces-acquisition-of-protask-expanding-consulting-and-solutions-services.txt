INSPYR Solutions Announces Acquisition of ProTask, Expanding Consulting and Solutions Services

Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Houston, Texas – INSPYR Solutions (the “Company”), a leading IT staffing and technology solutions firm, announced today that it has acquired ProTask, a strategic staffing and consulting agency. This acquisition will result in an even stronger national presence for INSPYR Solutions as the Company seeks to further build out its brand and expand its geographic footprint across the country.

Founded in 2002, INSPYR Solutions, which was formed through the combination of TekPartners, a P2P Company, and Genuent, has grown to employ nearly 2,000 professionals nationwide across twelve office locations.  The Company is an experienced and leading provider of information technology staffing and solutions to blue-chip customers across a variety of end markets. Since 2021, INSPYR Solutions has been a portfolio company of A&M Capital Partners.  

Based in Washington, D.C., ProTask is a regional provider of highly technical, strategic staffing and consulting services across numerous end markets, including financial services, healthcare, financial technology and telecommunications.  Founded in 2010, ProTask currently employs over 100 professionals with an array of skill sets. 

Kip Wright, Chairman and CEO of INSPYR Solutions, commented, “Our strategic plan includes the aggressive expansion of our geographic presence in the U.S. through both organic growth and purposeful acquisitions. ProTask stood out as an attractive team to join the INSPYR Solutions family due to their thriving business built on deep relationships and delivering quality technical resources to their client base. We are excited to welcome the ProTask team into the INSPYR Solutions family and look forward to building on this momentum for further growth and success.”

 “With the similarities and synergies between our two businesses, it made sense to join forces. Our objective with this transaction is to leverage their capabilities to accelerate our growth in the Mid-Atlantic region,” said Donna Gibb, President and Founder of ProTask. “I’m looking forward to having ProTask join the INSPYR Solutions family and work with their team to not only continue the momentum we have built to date but contribute to the achievement of INSPYR Solutions’ long term growth strategy.”
