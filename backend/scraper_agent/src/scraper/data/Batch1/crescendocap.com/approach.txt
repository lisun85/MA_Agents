Approach

Over the last decade, Crescendo has developed an investing approach that is simple and straightforward: we find great businesses eager to ascend, and provide operating expertise, capital and strategy support. We are devoted partners; we treat our companies’ owners, managers and employees with respect.

INTEGRITY
We maintain the highest integrity and ethical standards; we select deal partners who share our approach.

EXPERIENCE
We bring additional executive talent to all deals, whether, as in most cases, from Crescendo’s operating network, or, in others, via recruitment. These resources serve on the Board of Directors and/or assume an operating role.

TRANSPARENCY
We are open and responsive to sellers, intermediaries, lenders/co-investors and portfolio company management. We are the same people before and after a deal closes.

Investment Criteria

Crescendo is primarily focused on middle market, change-of-control transactions,
