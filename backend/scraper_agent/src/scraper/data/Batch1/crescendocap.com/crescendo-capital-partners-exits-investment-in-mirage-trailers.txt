Crescendo Capital Partners exits investment in Mirage Trailers

Crescendo Capital Partners, LLC (“Crescendo”) announces that it has exited its investment in Mirage Trailers LLC (“Mirage”) through a sale to Novae LLC (“Novae”).

Via a broad investor group including Mirage founder Rob Swikert, Crescendo led the Mirage acquisition, which was completed in 2015.

During Crescendo’s 6-year ownership period, the company grew revenue and EBITDA meaningfully, culminating in a record 2021.

In addition to the continued leadership of founder Swikert, the addition of key leaders, including GM Chad Hesse and CFO Alee Gilbert, facilitated and enabled this growth.

“
We are proud of Mirage’s growth; we believe Novae and Mirage will continue this growth trajectory.
Crescendo Founding Partner CL Turner, III

Financial terms were not disclosed.

CIBC Cleary Gull acted as exclusive financial advisor to the Mirage ownership group.

Mirage is a leading provider of enclosed trailers in the western US and Canada. Mirage, founded in 2003 and based in Nampa, ID, operates under two brand names, Mirage and TNT.
