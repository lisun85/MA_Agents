Urban Armor Gear NEW BRAND ALERT // U by UAG

Congratulations to HKW portfolio company, URBAN ARMOR GEAR, LLC (UAG) for introducing U, a new community and collection of cases designed to inspire women to be strong, athletic adventures.

The U designer, Alaina Appelbaum, as a child always had a sketchbook in hand and knew she would do something creative. Watch the behind the design video HERE.

Alaina said, “Sketching for ideation is more about where a pattern might go as opposed to what the pattern might be. The U line is meant to represent all the different ways women are going to be moving through their lives.”

Featured U Ambassador, Maddie Ryan, East coast surf all-star, known as the “Kennebunk Kid,” was born into a surfer family. When asked who inspired her to start surfing, she says “My parents have to be my biggest inspirations in surfing. They never forced me into it but it was either be in the water or sit on the beach.”
