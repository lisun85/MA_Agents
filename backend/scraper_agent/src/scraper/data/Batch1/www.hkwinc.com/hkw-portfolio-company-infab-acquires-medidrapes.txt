HKW Portfolio Company Infab Acquires MediDrapes
Add-on acquisition immediately expands Infab’s product offerings and customer base

INDIANAPOLIS, January 7, 2021 – HKW, a middle-market private equity firm focused on growth-oriented companies, today announced the acquisition of MediDrapes, Inc. (“MediDrapes” or the “Company”), a provider of sterile disposable protective drapes for medical imaging equipment, by Infab Corporation (“Infab”), an HKW-portfolio company and a provider of healthcare personal protective equipment (PPE), including x-ray shielding materials, aprons, glasses, barriers, gloves, and cleaners. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

MediDrapes provides a suite of sterile disposable protective coverings for medical imaging equipment. It offers covers for full size and mini c-Arms, fluoroscopes, and ultrasound machines, among other devices.

“We believe, the addition of MediDrapes to the Infab platform immediately increases their product line with a highly complementary offering,” said Tom Shaw, Principal at HKW. “This is also an opportunity for HKW to continue investing in the Health & Wellness sector, an important focus for us in 2021.”

Infab designs and builds lightweight, comfortable, and technologically advanced radiation protection products. Infab’s PPE products enable health care providers and patients to benefit from the diagnostic capabilities of imaging technology, functioning as a “one-stop-shop” for distributors and customers.

“We feel the acquisition of MediDrapes provides us an excellent opportunity to expand our direct reach to hospitals and health systems which are seeing an increasing need for imaging-related procedures,” said Don Cusick, Exec. Chairman of the Board at Infab. “We are excited to add the MediDrapes products to our catalog.”
