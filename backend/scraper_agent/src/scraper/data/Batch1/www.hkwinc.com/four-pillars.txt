A Robust,
New Approach
At HKW we continually challenge ourselves to improve.

We embrace this philosophy through our Four Pillar approach. We are proud of how this structure supports the strengths of each individual while promoting collaboration between the pillars. Our team-first culture places a significant emphasis on data-driven execution from the deal sourcing process through our exit-focused strategic growth initiatives.

The Four Pillars of Success
Sourcing
Transactions
Operations
Exits

Our dedicated Sourcing Team targets 1,000+ opportunities to review every year as it seeks to find profitable growth-oriented companies in the US and Canada. At HKW, we believe in building relationships through eye contact and a handshake. As a result, our Sourcing Team typically spends a combined 100 weeks on the road every year, connecting with people and building relationships.

The Sourcing Team conducts the initial review of prospective companies. If a prospective company meets the established criteria, the opportunity progresses to the Transaction Team.
