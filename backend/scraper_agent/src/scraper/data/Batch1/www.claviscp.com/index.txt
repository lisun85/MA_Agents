Clavis professionals are career operators, not financial engineers. All of our Principals have held leadership positions in large and small manufacturing and industrial companies across a number of different sectors throughout their careers. We bring an operator mindset to our investing activity. We bring experience. We bring connections. We bring resources. We bring our hard hat.

The company we keep.

Clavis Capital Partners is a private investment firm with deep experience in investing in, operating and growing US-based industrial businesses. We provide flexible capital to make control investments in a broad range of unique industrial-oriented companies that have built strong corporate cultures and are at an inflection point in their growth path.

WHO WE’VE PARTNERED WITH

They have a fresh perspective, are wicked smart and super fast, and still dive into the strategic planning.

Tammy P.

Chief Commercial Officer, DCG ONE

These guys aren’t your typical banker or PE types – they love operators and entrepreneurs and genuinely respect the existing culture that has been built. Super smart, value added, experienced and authentic.

Bo W.

CEO, Click Here Digital

They are truly an extension of my leadership team – deep into the details but also invaluable advisors on strategy development and execution. We strongly value our partnership with Clavis.

Scott C.

President, Solair

We selected Clavis as our partner because they quickly and accurately understood our business and valued the culture that we have built over 100 years. They are fantastic partners that are helping UCC accelerate our growth path for the next 100 years!
