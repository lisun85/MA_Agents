CLEVELAND, OH – December 10, 2018 – Ninth Street Capital Partners (NSCP) is pleased to announce the closing of an investment in Interior Building Systems (IBS), a Manassas, Virginia based commercial millwork manufacturer that serves the Washington D.C. Metropolitan area and the greater Mid-Atlantic region. NSCP will integrate IBS into its family of millwork companies, which operate under parent company USA Millwork. Terms were not disclosed.

“IBS is known throughout the region as the company to call when you have a tough job that has to be 100% right” said Michael Weiner, Managing Partner at NSCP. “With over 20 years of experience serving the Mid-Atlantic region, IBS brings a strong track record of leadership in commercial millwork. The management team is led by the Company’s founder Paul Bell, who shares our vision for a customer service oriented concept-to-completion manufacturer that provides finely crafted products.”

NSCP Managing Partner Patrick Dickinson added “we are excited to welcome IBS’s employees and customers into the USA Millwork family and are impressed with the accomplishments of Mr. Bell and his team. He has built IBS into a trusted partner to the region’s top general contractors, architects, and builders, and we believe we can learn from one another moving forward. USA Millwork sees tremendous opportunities for the new partnership as we focus on realizing the many collaborative initiatives that exist and continue to focus on expanding our national footprint.”

McDonald Hopkins provided legal counsel on the transaction and Flagstar Bank and Tecum Capital Partners provided financing.
