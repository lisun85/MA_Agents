Our Approach

Our fundamental investment approach involves three phases: the acquisition process; partnering with management; and long-term planning.

Once we have identified a candidate company, the acquisition process will take two to six months depending on the business. The length of the second phase, partnering with management, varies significantly. It is driven by the needs of the company and its management team. This phase includes a transition process post-closing as well as the establishment and implementation of a long-term strategy. Lastly, we will work with management to establish a long-term plan for the investment. The timeline below outlines these three phases.

The Castronics case study provides an example of our approach. It illustrates our strong partnership with management and our ability to commit personal and financial resources to our investments.
