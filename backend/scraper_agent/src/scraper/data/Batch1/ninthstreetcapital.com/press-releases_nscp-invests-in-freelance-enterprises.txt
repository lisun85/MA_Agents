CLEVELAND, OH – August 18, 2017 – Ninth Street Capital Partners (NSCP) is pleased to announce the closing of an investment in Freelance Enterprises (Freelance), a Denver based commercial millwork manufacturer. NSCP partnered with Freelance’s management team as well as Tecum Capital Partners to complete the acquisition. Terms were not disclosed.

“Freelance has provided concept-to-completion premium design and craftsmanship to the commercial millwork industry for over 25 years.  The company’s attention to customer service while providing finely crafted products has allowed the Freelance to grow since its founding. We believe that this partnership will best position the company to take advantage of the growing demand for commercial millwork in the Rocky Mountain Region of the U.S.,” said Weiner. “NSCP is investing substantially in Freelance’s facilities to help the company meet anticipated growth.”

“With an operating model that emphasizes quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, and customer service, Freelance is a trusted provider to the top general contractors, architects, and builders throughout the Front Range,” added Dickinson.

Freelance has played a critical role in providing millwork to the commercial remodeling and building markets for 25 years. “We see a tremendous opportunity to accelerate Freelance’s growth while continuing to provide exceptional service and craftsmanship to our customers.  Under the new ownership structure, we hope to support the company’s leaders as they grow the business,” said Weiner.
