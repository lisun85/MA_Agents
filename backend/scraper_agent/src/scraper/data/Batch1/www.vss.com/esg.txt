ESG
VSS believes that considering ESG factors helps us create a lasting impact in the lower-middle market for all of our stakeholders including investors, portfolio companies, employees and communities.
Our ESG Policy
Our Approach:
Systematic ESG Integration: We conduct comprehensive ESG assessments for all potential investments through a standardized pre-close diligence process, evaluating both risks and opportunities
Data-Driven Performance Tracking: Through our partnership with Novata, we collect and analyze over 50 ESG metrics semi-annually across our portfolio, enabling us to benchmark performance and drive improvements
Transparent Reporting: We are committed to maintaining regular communication with stakeholders through semi-annual portfolio company reporting and comprehensive annual ESG reports that highlight both achievements and areas for improvement

While VSS may consider certain ESG factors in screening, evaluating, or monitoring any investment or potential investment, these factors  are not intended to unnecessarily restrict our investment universe. However, investors should be aware that investing based on ESG factors may cause a strategy to forgo certain investment opportunities available to strategies that do not use such criteria. Due to the subjective nature of ESG investing, there can be no guarantee that the ESG criteria used by VSS will reflect the beliefs or values of any particular investor. VSS’s view of “ESG” is subject to change and VSS may revise its ESG-related activities, including ceasing any practices described herein, in whole or in part, at any time.  Offers and sales are only made via a confidential private placement memorandum (“PPM”) to accredited investors .
