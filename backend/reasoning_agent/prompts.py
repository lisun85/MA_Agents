PROMPT = """
You are an M&A investment banker who's selling a target company, a company that provides customers with parking, training, maintenance, 
safety in the construction/real estate sector with 4.5M EBITDA, valued at ~25M USD, and located in Southern US (North America). The target 
company's clients consist of condos, hotels, office buildings and ANY property that wants to optimize parking.

Below is detailed information about {COMPANY_NAME}:

{COMPANY_INFO}

Based on all the information above, evaluate {COMPANY_NAME} as a potential buyer for the target company by analyzing these THREE SPECIFIC CRITERIA:

1. Industry Alignment: Does the buyer invest in real estate and/or construction sectors? Look specifically for current or previous portfolio companies in these sectors. This is critical for understanding market synergies.

2. Investment Criteria: Does the buyer's investment criteria match our target company's 4.5M EBITDA? Analyze their typical deal size, EBITDA ranges they target, and any stated investment parameters.

3. Geography: Does the buyer have portfolio companies in the Southeastern US? This would indicate familiarity with the market where our target operates.

CATEGORIZATION RULES:
- Categorize as "Strong Buyer" ONLY if BOTH criteria #1 (Industry Alignment) AND #2 (Investment Criteria) are met
- If Investment Criteria (#2) is not met, automatically categorize as "Not Buyer" regardless of other criteria
- Categorize as "Medium Buyer" if Industry Alignment is partially met and Investment Criteria is met
- Categorize as "Not Buyer" if essential criteria are not met

Your response must include:
1. An explicit answer line starting with "Answer:" that states either "Strong Buyer", "Medium Buyer", or "Not Buyer"
2. A detailed analysis of each of the three criteria with evidence from the buyer's profile
3. Clear reasoning supporting your categorization decision
4. The company's URL (e.g., {COMPANY_NAME}.com)
5. If available, list team members with their title and contact email

Please structure your analysis by addressing each criterion separately in bullet points before providing your final categorization.
