discovery_task:
  description: >
    Conduct thorough research to identify family office investors located in Chicago, Illinois that have Assets Under Management (AUM) of $100 million or more.
    
    Focus on genuine family offices that manage substantial wealth for ultra-high-net-worth families,
    not wealth management firms that merely use "family office" in their marketing.
    
    For each family office discovered:
    1. Obtain their name
    2. Find their official website URL (if available)
    3. Note their location within Chicago (if specified)
    4. Identify any available information about their AUM (must be $100M+)
    5. Identify any available information about their investment focus
    
    Search specifically for phrases like:
    - "Chicago family office investors $100 million"
    - "Chicago-based family offices large AUM"
    - "private investment offices Chicago substantial assets"
    - "single family offices Chicago high net worth"
    - "multi-family offices Chicago $100M+"
    
    Use the EXA search tool to comprehensively search across multiple sources.
    Verify each entity you find is truly a family office (not a wealth management firm) AND likely has AUM of at least $100 million.
    
    Note: For family offices that don't publicly disclose their AUM, look for indirect indicators such as:
    - Size and value of known investments
    - Number of staff/professionals
    - Size and prestige of office location
    - Notable wealthy families associated with the office
    - Language indicating "substantial wealth" or similar terms
    
  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON array containing Chicago-based family offices with 
    their names, website URLs, locations, approximate AUM (when available), and investment focus.
    Each entry should include fields: name, url, location, estimated_aum, investment_focus, and a 
    confidence_score (1-10) indicating your confidence that this is a legitimate family office with AUM of $100M+.
    Include an aum_evidence field that briefly explains your reasoning for believing the family office meets the $100M+ threshold.

profile_scraper_task:
  description: >
    For each family office URL in this list: {discovered_offices}
    
    Visit their website and extract comprehensive profile information including:
    1. Low-level data: Full address, phone number, email (if available), founding year, key leadership team members and their roles
    2. AUM data: Look specifically for any direct or indirect information about Assets Under Management (AUM)
    3. High-level data: Investment philosophy, target sectors, geographic preferences, typical investment size,
       types of investments (direct, fund, etc.), and any specific statements about investment criteria
    
    Structure this information in a consistent format for each family office. Pay particular attention to 
    any mentions of previous investments or portfolio companies, especially the scale of investments that might 
    indicate substantial AUM. Look for information that indicates their investment approach, values, and decision-making criteria.
    
    Use the FirecrawlScrapeWebsiteTool to efficiently extract content from each website.
    
    For family offices without a website or with limited information, note this and provide whatever 
    information you can find.
  expected_output: >
    Detailed, structured profiles for each family office in JSON format, with consistent fields
    across all entries, capturing both factual information and investment approach insights.
    Include an "aum_estimate" field with your best estimate of their AUM (if available) and an
    "aum_evidence" field explaining what information supports this estimate.
    Include a "completeness_score" field for each profile (1-10) that indicates how complete
    the profile information is based on available data.
