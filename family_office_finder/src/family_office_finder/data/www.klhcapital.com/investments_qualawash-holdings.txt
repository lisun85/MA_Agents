Business Description

QualaWash is the nation’s largest provider of tank truck, tote, ISO tank, and rail car cleaning services to the bulk transportation industry. The company operates 53 strategically located facilities nationwide.

Transaction Overview

QualaWash was an orphaned division of a publicly traded company, Quality Distribution, Inc. KLH Capital partnered with the existing President of QualaWash to buy the division from the parent company in a corporate spin-off transaction.

Post Transaction

Immediately post-transaction, KLH established independent billing, accounting, and operating systems and facilitated the hiring of new sales executives to grow the existing business. After a year of partnership, KLH and management successfully acquired the nation’s largest independent steel intermediate bulk container cleaning provider and also acquired its largest competitor, PSC Container Services, LLC. These acquisitions quadrupled the size of the original business.
