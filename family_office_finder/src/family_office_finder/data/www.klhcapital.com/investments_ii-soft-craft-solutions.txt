Business Description

Headquartered in New Orleans, LA, with branches across the Gulf Coast, I&I Soft Craft Solutions is a leading industrial services provider with expertise in insulation, fireproofing, heat tracing, painting and coating, refractory, scaffolding, and abatement services for customers in the LNG, refining, chemical, gas processing, power, pulp and paper, general industrial, and marine industries, often working alongside the largest and most reputable industrial general contractors in the U.S. and abroad. Since its founding in 1970, Insulations has cultivated top-tier industry relationships with leading project owners and general contractors based on its thought leadership, project execution excellence, unrivaled safety record, and quality work product.

Transaction Overview

The owner of Insulations wished to create liquidity to diversify his wealth, reduce personal financial risk, and identify a capital partner to unlock certain growth opportunities. The owner also wished to provide ownership to key managers and begin developing a succession plan. KLH structured an investment that gave the owner partial liquidity for diversification, offered equity to key managers, and established a capital structure that removed personal guarantees and provided capacity for growth.
