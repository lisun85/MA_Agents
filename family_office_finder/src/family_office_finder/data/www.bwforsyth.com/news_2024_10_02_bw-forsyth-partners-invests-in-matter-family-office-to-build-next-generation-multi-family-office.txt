BW FORSYTH PARTNERS INVESTS IN MATTER FAMILY OFFICE TO BUILD NEXT-GENERATION MULTI-FAMILY OFFICE
Growth capital infusion provides opportunity to enhance bespoke, people-centric multi-family office

ST. LOUIS — Oct. 2, 2024 — BW Forsyth Partners, an investment firm with a perpetual, long-term investment horizon and evergreen capital base, has announced a strategic investment in Matter Family Office. Matter Family Office represents the seventh Forsyth portfolio company.

Established in 1990, Matter Family Office is a private wealth management firm and multi-family office, serving high-net-worth families and individuals in investment management and wealth planning. It is renowned for its integrated, comprehensive wealth management philosophy as well as distinctive culture and learning services. With a holistic approach and enduring client relationships, Matter has consistently garnered industry recognition for over three decades, solidifying its position as a thought leader in the field.


As part of its strategy of building great businesses through people, Forsyth will partner with Matter Founder, Partner and Managing Member, Kathy Lintz, and her team to further build Matter Family Office into a forward-thinking multi-family office that focuses on family culture, legacy and stewardship as well as traditional wealth management services. With the transaction, Forsyth has committed capital to fund organic growth initiatives, future acquisitions and strong cultural programs with the goal of creating enduring legacies for Matter clients, families and communities. Matter advisors and staff will continue in their existing roles and will remain the key point of contact for clients. Forsyth will join the Matter Board of Directors.


“This partnership represents a significant opportunity for both firms to leverage their combined expertise and resources to develop a higher impact family office for individuals, businesses and communities touched by the families served by Matter,” said Drew Frailey, partner at BW Forsyth Partners. “With additional capital and strategic support, Forsyth aims to empower Matter to expand its reach, deliver unparalleled value to clients, set a new standard for wealth management services and become a catalyst for positive change.”


Forsyth is committed to maintaining the high standards of service and personalized approach that Matter is known for. Clients can expect a seamless transition and continued focus on creating a legacy of success that transcends generations and builds a better world.


“As we evaluated partners, it quickly became clear that BW Forsyth Partners was the ideal partner for our firm and the right choice for our clients,” said Lintz. “Forsyth’s long-term, perpetual investment model strongly aligns with our multi-generational client base. The focus on business-building and increased resources from Forsyth will serve our clients into the future with confidence.”
