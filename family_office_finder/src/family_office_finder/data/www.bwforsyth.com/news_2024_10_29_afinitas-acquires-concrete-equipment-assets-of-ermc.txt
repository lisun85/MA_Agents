AFINITAS ACQUIRES CONCRETE EQUIPMENT ASSETS OF ERMC
Acquisition Strengthens Afinitas Equipment and Forming Systems Product Offerings

ST. LOUIS — October 25, 2024 – Afinitas, the leading global infrastructure equipment and services company, announced today it has acquired a major share of the concrete machinery and forming systems assets of Elk River Machine Company (ERMC), headquartered in Elk River, MN. ERMC parent company, Hutchinson Manufacturing, LLC, a private equity firm specializing in custom metal fabrication and large contract volume metal manufacturing, is divesting ERMC’s concrete equipment division to focus on its other businesses.

As part of the acquisition, Afinitas will take ownership of the intellectual property and assets of ERMC’s concrete product lines, including wire mesh benders, wire mesh rollers, cage expanders, wetcast and drycast forms, and retaining wall forming systems, among other products. In addition, ERMC’s Senior Designer Paul Gill will join the Afinitas team to assist with integrating these products into the Afinitas portfolio.

“The acquisition of ERMC’s technology, combined with our extensive offering, enables Afinitas to serve customers with an even more comprehensive selection,” said Jason Duncan, Afinitas CEO. “Equally important, we look forward to servicing and being a trusted resource to the current ERMC customer base.”
