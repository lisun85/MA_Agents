MACHINE SOLUTIONS INC. ACQUIRES CRESCENT DESIGN INC.
Crescent Design’s Hydraulic Burst Leak Tester joins a collection of best-in-class testing and manufacturing equipment for medical device manufacturers

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. – Aug. 25, 2020 – Machine Solutions Inc. has announced that it has acquired the assets and business of Crescent Design Inc. The acquisition brings together two advanced technology providers to the medical device industry. Crescent Design, headquartered in San Diego, designs and manufactures proprietary hydraulic burst leak test equipment, associated accessories and other auxiliary equipment used in the manufacturing of medical devices.

Machine Solutions and its industry-leading brands—MSI, Steeger USA, Vante, PlasticWeld Systems and SEBRA—continue to increase the range of products and services provided for medical device manufacturers. The acquisition of Crescent Design and its Hydraulic Burst Leak Tester adds another ISO 10555 test requirement to the list of catheter testing capabilities within Machine Solutions’ product catalog, and brings a global sales and service team to support and further develop the Crescent Design technology. The acquisition directly aligns with Machine Solutions’ long-term strategy to provide its customers with a single source for diverse equipment and services to meet their development, production and testing validation needs.

“Crescent Design’s Hydraulic Burst Leak Tester is the standard for testing in the catheter manufacturing industry,” said Machine Solutions President Brian Strini. “We are excited to add another best-in-class technology to our testing equipment catalog and look forward to the additional capabilities we can bring to our customers.”

“Over the years, I recognized the parallel paths that Machine Solutions and Crescent Design have shared—both are committed to quality, innovation and customer service, and I felt that we would work well together,” said Crescent Design Vice President and Co-Founder Steven Royce. “This partnership will provide additional resources to allow continued technical product improvements and in-person customer support in more locations around the world.”

Crescent Design President and Co-Founder Jay Sarno added: “This partnership provides us with the engineering resources needed to develop the next generation of market-leading burst leak testing equipment that will have improved accuracy, be easier to use and be compatible with emerging 21-CFR part 11 compliant test systems.”

Crescent Design is Machine Solutions’ fifth acquisition since joining the BW Forsyth Partners family of companies in 2012.
