SPILLMAN COMPANY JOINS WITH AFINITAS’ NEW HAMPTON METAL FAB
Transaction expands and enhances offerings for customers in the wet-cast concrete market

ST. LOUIS — Oct. 3, 2018 — New Hampton Metal Fabrication LLC (NHMF), an Afinitas company, is excited to announce a combination with the Spillman Company, a leading designer and manufacturer of custom wet-cast concrete forms. The company is also a provider of precast accessories relating to plastic spacers, magnetic products and automation solutions. This transaction strengthens and expands NHMF’s product portfolio for the wet-cast concrete industry.

Spillman, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, is led by President and Chief Executive Officer Ted Coons, who will continue with the combined business.

“We are incredibly excited to partner with New Hampton, and the larger Afinitas organization, and are confident that the combination of our two companies will position us well to provide enriched value and support for our customers,” said Coons. “We have always taken great pride in growing our brand and reputation in the industry, and we strongly believe that this partnership presents an ideal opportunity to expand our business to new markets and customers.”

Afinitas was formed to build out the vision of creating a global, comprehensive, customer-oriented infrastructure equipment and services platform through organic growth and acquisitions. Currently, the platform has three divisions, each with distinct brands, capabilities and leadership teams: HawkeyePedershaab and BFS (dry-cast equipment), NHMF (wet-cast forming) and CAM products (consumables). Spillman represents the second addition to the wet-cast division.

“Spillman offers a premium brand of products that are a natural extension of our current portfolio, while also enhancing the breadth of our offerings to our customers,” said Jamie Wegner, NHMF President. “Coming together allows us to formulate and execute on a vision of building a leading global supplier to the wet-cast industry through a more comprehensive set of solutions.”

Added Nick Wegner, NHMF Vice President: “We are honored and thrilled to welcome such a respected company and team to the New Hampton family. We are excited about the opportunities of leveraging decades of our combined company’s experience to strengthen our ability to provide long-term value to our customers.”
