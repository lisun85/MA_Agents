Managing Partner

Ryan is Managing Partner of BW Forsyth Partners, which he co-founded in 2009 as Forsyth Capital Investors, the investment arm of multi-billion dollar global manufacturing and engineering consulting firm, Barry-Wehmiller. Ryan works closely with our leadership teams to develop and execute organic growth plans, identify add-on acquisitions for existing companies, and source new platforms. He currently serves as Chairman of the Board for Machine Solutions Inc. and Afinitas Inc. and is also a member of the Board of Directors for Cor Partners Inc. and WalkerHughes Insurance.

Prior to founding Forsyth Capital Investors, Ryan worked at Banc of America Capital Investors, (now Ridgemont Equity Partners), a Charlotte, N.C.-based private equity fund with more than $2.0 billion under management. There, he completed ~$300 million in transactions across a number of industries, including business services, media & telecom, energy, and software. Prior to joining Banc of America Capital Investors, Mr. Gable was an analyst in Banc of America Securities Leveraged Finance group. 

Outside of the office, Ryan enjoys the outdoors, St. Louis Cardinals baseball, and spending time with his wife, Courtney, and their three children, Morgan, Devon and Colin. Ryan thoroughly enjoys coaching his kids’ sports teams and teaching them how to fish, one of his favorite pastimes.
