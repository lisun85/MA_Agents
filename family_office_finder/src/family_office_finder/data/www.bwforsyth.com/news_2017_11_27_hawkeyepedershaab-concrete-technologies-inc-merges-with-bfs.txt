HAWKEYEPEDERSHAAB CONCRETE TECHNOLOGIES INC. MERGES WITH BFS
Partnership broadens company’s product lines and geographic reach

MEDIAPOLIS, Iowa – Nov. 27, 2017 — HawkeyePedershaab Concrete Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce its merger with BFS Betonfertigteilesysteme GmbH. Through this partnership with BFS, HawkeyePedershaab will expand its presence in the concrete pipe and manhole machinery segment, and offer new product lines serving the pressure pipe, manhole, pole plant, and block and paver end-markets.

Headquartered in Blaubeuren, Germany, BFS is co-led by industry veterans Daniel Bühler and Klaus Mueller, who will continue with the business.

“BFS has a history of developing and producing high quality prefabricated concrete-production machinery,” stated Daniel Bühler, Managing Director of BFS. “Combining with HawkeyePedershaab greatly enhances the solutions we can offer to our collective customer bases.” Klaus Mueller, Managing Director of BFS, added: “I look forward to combining our two companies’ decades of experience in pursuit of continued innovation and strong customer service to the precast industry.”

“BFS’s products, and diverse customers and applications, strengthen HawkeyePedershaab’s vision of building a leading global supplier of production equipment for the precast concrete industry,” stated Brad Schmidgall, President of HawkeyePedershaab. “Our companies know each other well, and we are honored to be unifying our teams and sharing our people-centric culture.”

BW Forsyth Partners acquired HawkeyePedershaab in September 2016, with the goal of building the market-leading supplier of equipment and solutions for the precast concrete industry through organic growth and acquisitions.

“BFS’s leading brand, strong team and solutions-based product offerings make this an ideal opportunity for both companies,” said Ryan Gable, HawkeyePedershaab CEO and BW Forsyth Partners Managing Director. “We are thrilled to partner with BFS, and believe this combination will provide long-term growth and value to our customers, suppliers and the great teams at both companies.”
