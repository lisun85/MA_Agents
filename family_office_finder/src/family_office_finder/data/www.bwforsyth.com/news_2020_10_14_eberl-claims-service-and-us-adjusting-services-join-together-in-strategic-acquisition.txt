EBERL CLAIMS SERVICE AND U.S. ADJUSTING SERVICES JOIN TOGETHER IN STRATEGIC ACQUISITION
Combination of industry leaders will offer unified claims solutions for the insurance industry

LAKEWOOD, Colo. — July 21, 2020 — Eberl Claims Service and U.S. Adjusting Services have announced the combining of their business operations to offer unified claims solutions for the insurance industry. Eberl will acquire certain assets and the business of U.S. Adjusting Services, and both businesses will operate together as a collective force within the marketplace.

U.S. Adjusting Services, a family-owned business founded in 1993, has been a steadily growing organization, providing a complete range of claims adjusting, risk management and catastrophe support services for the insurance marketplace. The company’s people-centric approach, coupled with its long-term relationships with partners in the insurance community, provide a market-leading proposition. U.S. Adjusting Services sought and found a partner in Eberl that mirrored the company’s values and assured continuation of its legacy with clients and partners. Watch this video for more on the decision.

“Eberl’s acquisition of U.S. Adjusting Services is a combination of two complementary firms, with the purpose of providing world-class service for carrier partners, expanded opportunities for adjusters and growth possibilities for internal team members,” said Chris Bergeon, President of Eberl.

Jessica Hamilton, President of Client Development at U.S. Adjusting Services, also commented: “This opportunity is going to provide our employees with growth and leverage, and all-in-all, the sky’s the limit.”

The cultural and philosophical alignment across leadership teams was pivotal in both organizations’ decision to unify forces. Together, the companies display a full-service claims portfolio, an extensive national adjuster network and, in Bergeon’s words, “partners who accept nothing but the highest standards of service—which we are now more equipped than ever to deliver.”

Over the last several years, Eberl has invested in developing technology-enabled claims support systems to continually improve adjuster and partner experiences. Eberl plans on leveraging these advances to simplify business process integration and service delivery for the combined organizations. Both companies believe that a seamless transition is key to maintaining operating models that currently drive their individual success.

“Eberl is looking forward to extending these investments to the U.S. Adjusting Services adjusters and carrier partners as we integrate our businesses,” said Bergeon. “From there, we look to the future for additional innovative developments.”

While Eberl drives ongoing progress in the field of insurance technology, U.S. Adjusting Services has made significant strides in claims education and brings to the unified venture the stand-alone but affiliated Catastrophe Adjuster Training Institute (CATI). CATI delivers comprehensive training opportunities for carrier partners and independent adjusters spanning the nation. With Eberl’s state-of-the-art training facility located in Dallas, these programs now form a singular powerhouse in the scope of claims-handling instruction and learning.

By combining two industry leaders into one, Eberl strengthens its commitment to its mission—to be there when you need us—and pushes forward in the pursuit to be the industry’s leading claims-solutions provider. For more about this strategic acquisition, watch this video.
