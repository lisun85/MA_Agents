HAWKEYEPEDERSHAAB CONCRETE TECHNOLOGIES INC. COMBINES WITH CAM SALES
Acquisition expands company’s offerings for the concrete market

MEDIAPOLIS, Iowa — May 17, 2018 — HawkeyePedershaab Concrete Technologies Inc. is pleased to announce its acquisition of CAM Sales Inc., the leading manufacturer of prefabricated shear steel stirrup assemblies for concrete pipe, box culverts and other concrete structures. The company also is a leading manufacturer of reinforcement accessories and a provider of precast concrete production equipment in North America. With this acquisition, HawkeyePedershaab expands its product offerings for the concrete industry.

Headquartered in Ludington, Michigan, CAM Sales is led by President James Wright, who will continue with the business.

“We are pleased to partner with HawkeyePedershaab, which is committed to providing continued support to our customers and enhancing all aspects of our business,” said Wright. “We are confident that our strong brand and reputation, combined with the scale of the HawkeyePedershaab platform, will allow us to further establish CAM Sales as the premier manufacturer of reinforcement accessories for the concrete industry.”

BW Forsyth Partners acquired HawkeyePedershaab in September 2016, with the goal of building the market-leading supplier of equipment and solutions for the precast concrete industry through organic growth and acquisitions.

“CAM Sales offers a highly regarded brand of products that are complementary to ours and a natural extension of our current solutions,” said Brad Schmidgall, HawkeyePedershaab President. “Joining together allows us to execute our strategic vision to provide an even broader set of capabilities to meet our customers’ needs.”

Added Ryan Gable, HawkeyePedershaab CEO and BW Forsyth Partners Managing Director: “By bringing together our two teams, not only will we be able to enrich our already robust offerings for our customers and grow our relationships, but we also have the opportunity to share our people-centric culture more widely.”
