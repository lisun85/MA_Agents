BW FORSYTH PARTNERS CONTINUES GROWTH OF MACHINE SOLUTIONS PLATFORM WITH THREE COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS IN 2020
Platform aims to offer medical device manufacturers a single source for equipment and services

ST. LOUIS — Jan. 7, 2021 — BW Forsyth Partners’ Machine Solutions, a provider of advanced equipment and services for the medical device market, continued its strong growth trajectory in 2020, acquiring Crescent Design Inc., Beahm Designs Inc. and BW-TEC AG. Since BW Forsyth Partners acquired Machine Solutions in 2011, the business has completed seven total acquisitions, including the three 2020 additions.

“Through the first ten years of our partnership, we have seen Machine Solutions build a strong reputation as a premier global provider of technology and services for medical device customers,” said Brian Holthouse, Partner at BW Forsyth Partners.

Machine Solutions and its industry-leading brands—MSI, Steeger USA, Vante, PlasticWeld Systems, Crescent Design, Beahm Designs, BW-TEC and SEBRA—continue to increase the range of products and services provided for medical device manufacturers through both internal product development, as well as strategic acquisitions.

“I am excited about the future of this business and our team’s capabilities, as we continue to expand through both organic growth and our partnerships with other providers for the medical device industry,” said Ryan Gable, Managing Partner at BW Forsyth Partners.

“The BW Forsyth Partners ‘buy and build’ strategy has been one of the key drivers of growth for Machine Solutions, almost quadrupling the size of the business since 2011,” said Brian Strini, President of Machine Solutions. “Our people-centric culture, focus on continuous improvement and long-term strategic view enable us to make decisions based on what is best for our team members, customers and company. This approach has helped us build a healthy, sustainable business that provides security for our team members, communities and customers.”
