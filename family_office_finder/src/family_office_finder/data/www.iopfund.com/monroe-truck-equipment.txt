TITLE: Monroe Truck Equipment | Industrial Opportunity Partners

BASE CONTENT:
================================================================================
Monroe is a powerful example of IOP’s operational focus and specialized sector knowledge shifting a successful middle-market industrial company into the next gear.

Monroe is a Wisconsin-based company that designs, manufactures, distributes and installs specialized truck equipment used in municipal and commercial applications. They are a leader in snow- and ice-related equipment including truck bodies, snow plows and hitches, and de-icing equipment.

Monroe’s owners were seeking partial liquidity and a partner to help them through some operational challenges, causing long lead times and lost sales opportunities.

They ultimately chose IOP based on our operational focus and experience with specialty vehicle markets. We viewed Monroe as having a reputation for quality and smart design, with strong potential for more efficient operations that would support accelerated growth.

THE DEAL + OPERATING THESES

Together, we structured a deal where Monroe’s three owners retained a meaningful stake in their company and remained in their management roles. IOP Operating Principal Andy Weller, who had significant experience with the commercial vehicle market and retooling similar manufacturing processes, joined as Chairman.

We collaborated to develop several operating theses aimed at increasing production capacity through improved usage of automation and new investments, making better use of engineering and management talent, expanding sales with thoughtful new products and exploring strategic add-ons.

THE PARTNERSHIP + RESULTS

Monroe’s management and IOP have implemented several key strategic and operational initiatives :

ROOM FOR NEW ORDERS.

We implemented changes based on lean manufacturing principles and automated processes, reducing lead times and increasing productivity. The moves expanded production capacity while maintaining quality.

BANDWIDTH FOR DEVELOPMENT.

We streamlined the product portfolio. With thoughtful cuts to the lineup, the engineers could give more attention to core products and have bandwidth for new-product development.

MORE FOCUSED MANAGEMENT.

We created more narrowly defined roles in the org chart, enabling senior management to focus more on overall strategy and less on day-to-day operations.

SIMPLER SUPPLY CHAIN.

We identified common materials and components to trim the supplier base, reducing costs and admin time. We re-engineered high-volume fabrications with castings in order to redeploy skilled employees to better uses.

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

We worked with the founders to develop individual transition plans along with identifying the future leaders of the company.

The company continues to evolve. In 2017, Monroe acquired Towmaster, strengthening Monroe’s footprint in the Midwest. The acquisition increased their scale in the snow and ice market, and added a complementary commercial trailer product serving customers in construction, landscaping and agricultural markets.
