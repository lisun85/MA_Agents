Crescendo Invests in Montbleau & Associates and Northwest Woodworks

Crescendo Capital Partners, LLC (“Crescendo”) is pleased to announce its acquisition of Montbleau & Associates (“Montbleau”) and Montbleau’s subsequent acquisition of Northwest Woodworks. Based in San Diego, CA and Woodinville, WA, respectively, Montbleau and Northwest Woodworks provide custom architectural woodwork to commercial customers across a wide range of end-markets and geographies.

First Merchants Bank provided senior debt, and Callodine Strategic Credit and Muzinich & Co. provided junior debt and equity co-investments to support the transaction. The sellers of both companies retain equity positions in the new combined business and will continue in their leadership roles.

Ron Montbleau, CEO of Montbleau, commented, “I am excited to partner with Crescendo and Northwest Woodworks in this next phase of Montbleau’s tremendous growth story. Crescendo’s experience investing in the trades and helping companies scale will propel us forward as we seek to become a nationally recognized player in the millwork space. I couldn’t be more excited for the future of the Company.”

“Northwest has grown consistently over the prior several decades, but we believe partnering with Montbleau and Crescendo will unlock untapped growth potential for the Company. Between Crescendo’s company building expertise and Montbleau’s world-class operations, Northwest found the ideal partners to take our company to the next level” James Mekeel, President of Northwest Woodworks, noted.

“Partnering with Montbleau and Northwest Woodworks represents another opportunity to implement Crescendo’s time-tested thesis of partnering with best-in-class companies and accelerating growth by implementing the systems, processes, and infrastructure required to develop a national footprint,” Michael MacRitchie, Partner at Crescendo, said.

Joel Gaynor, Senior Vice President at Crescendo, noted, “Montbleau and Northwest Woodworks have established themselves as the top architectural millwork firms in their respective markets. We look forward to working with both management teams and helping them achieve their next evolution of growth.”
