Peltram Plumbing Holdings (“P3 Holdings”, or “P3”), through its operating company Precision Plumbing and Service (“Precision”), announced the acquisition of E.R.

P3 is a portfolio company of Crescendo Capital Partners (“Crescendo”).

“
We’ve known Dave and Laura Parker for many years and have a high degree of respect for them and the business that they have built. ER Plumbing Services is a wonderful business and a complementary addition to the existing Precision commercial service platform.

Knowing Justin and Precision as well as we do, we are confident that we have found partners who share our values, culture and approach to business. The combination of Precision and ER Plumbing will make for a stronger company in the future than exists today and I look forward to the next stage of growth.”
