In a relay, the first lap runner ALWAYS hands the baton to a fresher runner.  On 1/1/25, I’ll formally pass the Crescendo MGP baton to Mike MacRitchie.

After 5000 flights and 3000 hotel nights, I’m the wheezing guy who barely finished his lap. Mike MacRitchie is the (much) fresher runner, poised to take the baton. He will undoubtedly post a faster time.

Crescendo LOI’s state that “We work hard, make money and have fun.” This motto has/is/will be true for Crescendo.

Thanks to providence and great colleagues, my ad hoc effort to “buy a few companies” evolved into a real firm. As Post Malone says, “I had some help (a lot!).” Mike is Crescendo professional #2. Mike suggested another colleague, Brendan Nyhan, and Crescendo … just … kept … growing. Crescendo has 7 investment pro’s, 1 marketing pro, 4 operating pro’s and third-party capital. As a rare construction-focused firm, Crescendo has closed ~15 platforms, 40+ acquisitions and deployed ~$0.5B (including debt) with half its outcomes at 7+x, including a large portion of partner capital.

Overall, Crescendo has succeeded beyond my imagination in terms of team development and financial outcomes. Many thanks, particularly to the Crescendo team – Mike M, Brendan, Joel, Bryan, Ryan E, Ryan D, Ali, Noah, Mike W, Dick, Gary and (former colleague) Justin. Crescendo’s future is bright. Our firm hasn’t crescendoed; the loudest successes are not yet realized. I expect future Crescendo successes to splash at max volume; some might say, like an Arctic Wave.

The Crescendo name is, very intentionally, a musical term, soft-to-loud, and our objective for portcos. I am a failed musician (Marley covers, mainly) from my 20’s and a professional/avocational musician now at 60. It helps to have world-class bandmates – in business (Crescendo) and music (Arctic Wave), as I do.

In the future, my time will be dedicated to my wife Mei, who has sacrificed greatly, and also to my daughter (my soulmate and heartbeat, respectively). I’ll remain active in a few Crescendo portcos and as an investor. I have a new foundation in the works, KN2, “Kids Need 2,” designed to help divorcing fathers maintain proximity to their children (a subject with which I am familiar). And, of course, before/now/always – music! Arctic Wave just recorded album 3 at East-West Studios in LA – just as Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Tom Petty, Ariana Grande, The Beach Boys and Ziggy Marley before us, to slightly more fanfare.

Catch you on the upbeat. CL
