Platform Investments

Gemini Investors is a private company investor with a focus on the smaller end of the middle market, investing in established companies with experienced management teams and good growth prospects. We can provide both equity and debt capital and our investment can represent either a minority ownership or a control transaction. Areas of particular investment interest for us are: Business Services, Consumer Products and Services, Healthcare, Later Stage Technology, Manufacturing & Distribution, and Waste & Recycling. Gemini has invested in over 170 different companies throughout the United States since our firm was founded in 1993.

Committed to the Middle Market

Founded in 1993, Gemini is a Massachusetts-based investor in smaller middle market private companies. Since our inception, we have invested over $700 million in more than 170 companies throughout the U.S., generally investing $3 to $8 million per transaction to acquire both control and minority stakes. Gemini offers a flexible investment approach.

ABOUT US
Flexible Approach to Investing

Gemini does not take a “one size fits all” approach to its investment strategy. We work with each company to create an individualized structure that best meets the needs of that business and the objectives of its stakeholders. Our more than twenty years of investment experience are as diverse as the companies with which we partner.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Building Expertise through Experience

Gemini has built an experienced and cohesive team of investment professionals. The firm’s general partners have worked together since the early 2000s, and collectively bring 120+ years of experience in private company investing, business management, investment banking, venture capital, management consulting, and public accounting. Beyond providing capital, our investment team has the knowledge, expertise, contacts, and other resources to assist management in all aspects of corporate growth.
