NSCP invests in GSS

12/19/2012 | By: Ninth Street Capital Partners

CLEVELAND, OH – Ninth Street Capital Partners, a Cleveland-based private investment firm, is pleased to announce it has acquired a minority stake in Guided Surgery Solutions, LLC (GSS). This investment marks the firm’s first pure play in the venture space. Terms were not disclosed.

Headquartered in Wellesley, Mass., Guided Surgery Solutions designs, manufactures, and sells 3-D image-based drill guides for dental implant surgery. The ThinLayer™ Drill Guide System was developed in the founder’s clinical practice, in response to the design limitations of existing products. The solution makes guided surgery technically and economically feasible for all implant surgeons, allowing them to provide better treatment to more patients. Though Ninth Street has historically invested in more mature businesses, the partners felt that GSS was a unique opportunity to disrupt a mature industry.
