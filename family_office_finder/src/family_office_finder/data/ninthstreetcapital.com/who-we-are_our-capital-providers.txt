Our Capital Providers

Ninth Street Capital Partners has access to over $200 million of equity through its partners and investor base. The firm has worked with the majority of its investors since the founding of NSCP and continues to develop new capital partners as its investment base expands. NSCP’s investors include several family offices as well as high net worth individuals. 

In addition to capital, these investors bring a wide range of industry expertise. They and our advisors have hands-on operating experience across a diverse range of industries ranging from healthcare to manufacturing.

NSCP also draws upon a deep bench of debt providers to finance its transactions. This diverse pool of lenders provides capital that complements NSCP’s equity investors and allows the firm’s partners to formulate the most appropriate capital structure for each transaction.
