WHAT WE BELIEVE
Our guiding principles.
Growth Orientation

Our focus is on growth opportunities, not cost-cutting programs. Growth is exciting and inspiring. Cost-cutting hurts morale and affects people’s lives. As a result, we are most interested in platform opportunities with good organic growth and add-on pathways.

Patience

Our focus is on the long term, not next quarter or next year. Often, we expect the profitability of our portfolio companies will decline in the first few periods as we invest in new resources to achieve longer term growth.

Perspective

We’ve been around the block a few times and have seen our share of successes and failures. Collectively, our team has participated in 50+ transactions representing over $1 billion of capital deployed. Some worked. Others didn’t. As a result, we have a pretty good perspective on what works, what doesn’t and how long it takes to get to the finish line.

Responsible Leverage

Debt is cheap capital. It’s also dangerous when overused. We limit the amount of debt capital that we use in our transactions to ensure that we don't put our portfolio companies at risk. We don't use debt for dividend recaps.

Strong Sense of Self

We know who we are and, more importantly, who we are not. We are comfortable in our skin and are not convinced that we are the smartest people in the room. We value different perspectives and experiences and the people who share them.

Win-Win Culture

We purposely look for win-win opportunities where our investment can benefit not only our investors and the seller, but the remaining employees, customers and the community.
