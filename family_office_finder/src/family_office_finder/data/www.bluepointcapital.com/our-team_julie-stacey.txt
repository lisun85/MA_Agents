================================================================================
Julie joined the group in 2023. With nearly fifteen years’ experience in talent leadership roles for private equity firms, she is a key partner to Blue Point and its management teams, assisting with talent management and acquisition initiatives in alignment with their strategic growth plans.

Prior to Blue Point, Julie was most recently the Head of Talent for Altamont Capital Partners, responsible for leading the firm’s executive talent initiatives. Previously, she spent nearly a decade at Sterling Partners, building the Human Capital function, to drive growth within the firm and across the portfolio.

Julie holds a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems and Human Resource Management from Ohio University.

Outside of the office, Julie and her family fit in as much adventure travel as they can, in between their sons’ various sports seasons, and she ‘attempts’ to find calmness within a yoga studio.
