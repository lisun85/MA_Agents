CLEVELAND, O.H. / June 6, 2024 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company Sylvan are pleased to announce the addition of Anchor Conveyor Products, a prominent engineering and fabrication contractor focused on industrial conveyor systems, to the growing Sylvan platform.


As a turnkey contractor for over one hundred years to some of the nation’s largest industrial facilities, Anchor helps expand Sylvan’s in-house fabrication capabilities and supports its delivery of all-in-one, multi-trade services to its customers.

“Over the years, the Sylvan team has deliberately advanced the platform toward its mission of providing a market-leading portfolio of comprehensive services to a diverse set of customers,” said Sylvan CEO Rob Metz. “With the additional capabilities of Anchor, Sylvan’s Conveyor Group is a powerhouse providing a wide range of customized solutions as our platform continues to grow.”

Since Sylvan partnered with Blue Point in 2018, the platform has completed multiple operational enhancements, including adding key personnel and implementing a new ERP system to drive efficiency and data-driven decision-making to support continued growth. Recognizing the opportunity to deepen its market position through geographic expansion and strategic M&A, Sylvan previously acquired Great Lakes Mechanical in 2021, adding additional HVAC and commercial building services and sheet metal fabrication capabilities. Furthermore, Sylvan has executed successful greenfield initiatives in several new geographies, including the recent addition of a Phoenix, Arizona office.

“Growing Sylvan’s depth and breadth of capabilities through organic and M&A efforts has been a strategic focus since the start of our partnership,” said Blue Point Partner Jonathan Pressnell. “We have made investments in the platform from the beginning of our ownership, and we’re seeing the compounding effect of those efforts on the business’s growth. Blue Point continues to be enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for Sylvan.”
