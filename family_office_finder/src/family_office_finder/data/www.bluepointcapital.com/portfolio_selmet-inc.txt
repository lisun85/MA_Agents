Business Description

Selmet is a leading manufacturer of complex titanium castings and machined parts for aerospace and defense applications.

Value Creation

First Institutional Capital

Partnered with an entrepreneur-owned business with significant value creation potential.

Local Partnership

Partnered alongside a business located close to our Seattle office, forging a strong cultural fit and steady level of strategic planning and collaboration with the Blue Point deal team.

Global Supply Chain Strategies

Blue Point’s Global Supply Chain team assisted Selmet’s management in identifying international suppliers for production materials such as yttria, garnet sand and wire mesh.

Human Capital

Blue Point helped Selmet augment its already top-tier management team by making several new hires, many with extensive industry expertise. Across the organization, Selmet developed its sales organization and created positions to support its strategic pricing strategy.

M&A

Selmet executed two add-on acquisitions, Onamac and Western Metrology, both of which enabled the delivery of fully machined, ready-to-install castings and increased capacity as well as machining and manufacturing capabilities. Blue Point also supported a considerable investment to increase Selmet’s capacity for large parts, increase in-house machining capabilities and gain operational efficiencies. These were transformational investments that enabled dramatic organic growth.
