Blue Point has been included on Association for Corporate Growth (ACG) 2024 list of 100 Notable Acquisitions for the recapitalization of Pinnacle MEP.

In October 2024, we announced the partnership with Pinnacle MEP Holdings, an HVAC and plumbing services provider with a strong presence across the Midwest. Together, we're focused on driving growth by enhancing Pinnacle’s capabilities and scale, leveraging Blue Point’s deep experience in the business services sector and extensive operating resources.

This honor highlights 100 notable platform deals completed by private equity firms in the fourth quarter of 2024, based on data that ACG extracted from Private Equity Info.

A big thank you to ACG for the recognition, and congratulations to the Blue Point and Pinnacle teams for their hard work and collaboration!
