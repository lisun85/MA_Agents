CLEVELAND / Jan. 11, 2024 / Blue Point Capital Partners and its portfolio company, Transtar Holding Company, are pleased to announce the acquisition of Arch Auto Parts, the largest independently owned parts distribution business in the greater New York City area. This transaction continues Transtar Holding Company’s growth and momentum in the general repair market following the successful addition of C&M Auto Parts in early 2023.

Known as “Your Neighborhood Auto Parts Store,” Arch began in 1979 with one location in Queens and has since expanded to 21 stores and two warehouses, serving the Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx and Long Island markets. The auto parts retailer has a dedicated focus on customer service, product delivery and extensive inventory offerings.

“Arch Auto Parts aligns perfectly with our strategic goals and marks the largest acquisition for Transtar Holding Company in general automotive repair parts distribution,” said Transtar Holding Company President & CEO Neil Sethi. “Arch significantly expands our general repair presence in the Northeast, and our team is focused on continuing to pursue similar acquisitions to accelerate our penetration of additional geographies.”

Arch joins NexaMotion Group, a family of innovative, industry-leading automotive aftermarket businesses that provides distribution excellence and e-commerce solutions for its partner companies. With Blue Point’s support, Transtar Holding Company plans to pursue more acquisitions, further building out the breadth of the portfolio’s capabilities, offerings and geographies served.

“The Transtar Holding Company team identified an excellent fit for NexaMotion’s growth strategy in Arch Auto Parts,” said Blue Point Partner Brian Castleberry. “We will continue to support Transtar’s organic growth while maintaining our emphasis on innovative general repair distribution acquisitions that will add to the platform.”

Transtar Holding Company is a portfolio of businesses that provides world-class customer service, technology solutions, distribution, and manufacturing of OE and aftermarket automotive products. Its business units include NexaMotion Group for the aftermarket industry and CoverFlexx Group for vehicle and equipment coatings.

NexaMotion Group’s mission is to simplify complex vehicle repair to keep the world moving. NexaMotion helps automotive professionals shift into high gear with next-level solutions and innovation. Backed by 49 years at the forefront of the aftermarket industry, NexaMotion Group combines the power of strong connections and expansive customer-driven product solutions.
