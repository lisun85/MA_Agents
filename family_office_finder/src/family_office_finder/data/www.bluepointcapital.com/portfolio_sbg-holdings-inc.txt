Business Description

SBG, the holding company of SASE and Bartell Global, is the leading provider of branded consumables and associated equipment for the conversion and ongoing maintenance of concrete flooring. SBG distributes its comprehensive portfolio of high-quality products such as diamond tooling, abrasives, chemicals, dyes, grinding machines and floor scrapers through a dual-channel go-to-market strategy selling both direct-to-contractor and through distributors.

Value Creation

First Institutional Capital

Partnered with an entrepreneur-owned business with significant value creation potential.

M&A

Completing multiple acquisitions was a critical part of the value creation strategy, including the 2021 acquisition of Bartell Global – a provider of surface preparation equipment and tooling as well as consumables – which was a deal that successfully brought SASE’s direct-to-contractor and Bartell’s distribution channel brands together. Under Blue Point’s ownership, SBG more than doubled its workforce and expanded from two U.S. locations to 10 sites across North America, the UK, South Korea and Singapore to offer more solutions and support to a broad spectrum of contractors around the world.

Data & Digital

In partnership with Blue Point, SBG implemented numerous Data & Digital improvements, including developing PowerBI dashboards for sales and manufacturing, the consolidation of and across several ERP systems, and pricing initiatives.

Global Supply Chain

Blue Point’s Global Supply Chain team helped SBG complete various supply chain improvement projects, including generating cost savings on equipment parts and reduce equipment component SKUs through sub-assembly sourcing, which streamlined assembly and reduced inventory complexity.

Human Capital

A critical factor to SBG’s operational growth was the meaningful investment in human capital at the Company. Blue Point assisted SBG in making several key C-Suite hires, including the Company’s CEO to complete the founders’ planned retirement transition to the board, as well as added a CFO and developed a solid supporting bench in IT, human capital, finance and sales.
