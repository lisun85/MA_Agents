Business Description

Pinnacle is a provider of mechanical contracting services, including HVAC, plumbing and insulation, in the Midwest. The Company is focused on serving primarily commercial customers with projects ranging from annual equipment tune-ups to whole facility retrofits. Pinnacle serves its communities by leveraging local, trusted technicians combined with the resources of a scaled corporate operation.

Post-Transaction

With Blue Point’s support, Pinnacle will continue to evolve its data-driven decision-making by enhancing sales and operational analytics capabilities, enabling organic growth through geographic expansion and strategic M&A, as well as scaling and developing technician recruitment, retention, training and safety capabilities. We will complement Pinnacle’s strong organic growth trajectory by leveraging our significant experience with field-based service businesses and our Data & Digital, Human Capital and Global Supply Chain value creation resources.

Add-On Acquisition Criteria

Pinnacle is interested in pursuing add-on opportunities within the fragmented sector landscape to expand its service offering, enhance cross-selling and labor sharing, and expand its footprint.

In November 2024, Pinnacle acquired Bell Plumbing Services, a provider of commercial plumbing solutions, collaborating with general contractors and direct customers throughout central and eastern Indiana; the Company’s geographic footprint perfectly complements Pinnacle’s established regional presence.
