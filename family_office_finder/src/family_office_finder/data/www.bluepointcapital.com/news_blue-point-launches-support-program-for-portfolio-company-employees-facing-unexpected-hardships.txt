CLEVELAND / October 24, 2024 / Blue Point Capital Partners is proud to introduce the Blue Point Cares Program, an initiative aimed at providing charitable relief funds for Blue Point portfolio company employees facing unexpected personal hardships.

Blue Point Cares is designed to offer financial assistance during critical moments, such as unforeseen medical expenses, property damage, family bereavement or transportation issues. Blue Point will contribute funds to establish the program upon closing individual platform investments.

“When our employees succeed, we all succeed,” said NSA President Chuck Grossman, whose company is the first Blue Point portfolio company to implement the initiative. “We’re appreciative of Blue Point Cares as an additional resource to help our NSA team members during challenging times.”

The program will primarily be managed by Canary, a third-party provider that specializes in administering employee relief funds. Canary will oversee the grant application and approval process, ensure compliance with IRS regulations and manage day-to-day administration.

“When 60% of Americans experience financial shocks each year, it's imperative to expand the safety net for individuals experiencing these sudden hardships,” said Canary Founder & CEO Rachel Schneider. “Blue Point is setting a standard in the private equity industry — one that prioritizes care and support for the well-being of their portfolio company employees.”

“Blue Point has always been committed to supporting the well-being and prosperity of our portfolio company employees, and the Blue Point Cares Program is a meaningful, tangible way to extend that support, especially during some of life’s toughest moments,” said Blue Point Partner Jonathan Pressnell. “We’re proud to roll out this impactful initiative, reflecting our deep appreciation for the hardworking individuals who contribute to the success of our portfolio companies every day.”




Canary’s technology and services enable their clients — employers, investment firms, nonprofits and others — to give individuals money at pivotal moments in their lives, with dignity and efficiency. They connect the latest technology and payments innovations to the innate and enduring human desire to help each other.
