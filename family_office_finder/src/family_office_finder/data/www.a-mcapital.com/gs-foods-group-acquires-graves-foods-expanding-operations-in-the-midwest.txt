GS Foods Group Acquires Graves Foods – Expanding Operations in the Midwest

New acquisition enhances presence in Midwest region and Strengthens operations for the future

GS Foods, a world class foodservice distributor owned by affiliates of Highview Capital and A&M Capital Partners(“AMCP”), today announced its acquisition of Graves Foods, a leading foodservice distributor headquartered in Jefferson City, Missouri.    

With more than 50 years of industry experience, GS Foods encompasses a family of specialized companies that provides trusted food distribution and product solutions nationwide. The acquisition of Graves follows GS Foods’ recent acquisition of C&C produce, headquartered in Kansas City, and the opening of their Wright City, Missouri distribution center.

“Integrating Graves Foods into the GS Foods’ family solidifies our role as a leading operator in the Midwest region”, said Sean Leer, CEO, GS Foods. “Together, we bring over 100 years of experience to the table for customers. We are excited to incorporate the Graves family into our leadership team knowing they share our commitment to providing the highest-quality products and best service in the industry.”

Founded in 1947, Graves Foods has established itself as a dependable source of foodservice products and services in the Midwest, serving Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Iowa, and Illinois. Building on decades of experience, Graves provides products and services to diverse sectors including healthcare, education, restaurants, convenience, and hospitality.

“After many years of growth and expansion, Graves Foods is excited to reach another key milestone – integrating with a leading national food distributor that shares our company values,” said Dick Graves. “As a family-founded business, we, along with our experienced and valuable team, take great pride in feeding the Midwest in a friendly and responsible way as any family would. GS Foods shares this philosophy and today’s combination will not only enhance our commitment to customers but strengthen our operations for the future.”

As part of the acquisition, the Graves family leadership team will join GS Foods and collaborate closely with the team going forward. Both companies expect a seamless transition for both employees and customers.
