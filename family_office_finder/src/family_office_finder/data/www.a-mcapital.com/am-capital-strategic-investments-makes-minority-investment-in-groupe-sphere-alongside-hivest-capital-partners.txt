A&M Capital Strategic Investments Makes Minority Investment in Groupe SPHERE Alongside Hivest Capital Partners

December 10, 2024 – A&M Capital Strategic Investments (“AMCSI”) is pleased to announce a minority investment in Groupe SPHERE (“SPHERE” or the “Company”), the European leader in sustainable household packaging, alongside majority investor Hivest Capital Partners S.A.S. (“Hivest Capital”), an independent European private equity firm. AMCSI and Hivest are making the investment in partnership with the Persenda family, SPHERE’s executives, and employee shareholders. AMCSI’s partnership in SPHERE follows other investments made by A&M Capital funds in the packaging industry, including Carton Pack, ProAmpac, and STOK.

Founded in 1976, SPHERE is a French family-owned group known for its commitment to sustainable packaging, with approximately 70% of its sales derived from recycled or compostable bio-based materials. As a leading European provider of household packaging, SPHERE manufactures and distributes a broad range of products for consumer, professional, and public sector markets. Its offerings include waste bags, collection bags, fruit and vegetable bags, freezer bags, cooking bags, reusable shopping bags, films and papers for food and non-food contact, aluminum trays and rolls, disposable tableware, and containers for take-away food, among others.

SPHERE’s development strategy focuses on creating packaging solutions for future generations, with key objectives to:

Use appropriate materials based on product end-of-life;
Increase the use of recycled, bio-based, and compostable materials;
Expand production of compostable bio-based raw materials; and
Design low-environmental-impact materials.

With 15 production sites across Europe, including seven in France, and an annual production capacity of 235,000 tons of films and bags, SPHERE generated sales close to €800 million in 2023 and employs over 1,600 people. This capital reconfiguration enables SPHERE to accelerate its ambitious development plan, strengthening its position as a leader in its European markets and facilitating potential external growth opportunities.
