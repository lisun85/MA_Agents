Portfolio Company Update: SALT Dental Partners
DALLAS, TEXAS
APRIL 10, 2024

Latticework Capital Management (“LCM”), a Dallas-based private equity firm focused on partnering with entrepreneurially-minded management teams to build leading healthcare companies, is proud to provide a 2023 year in review for its portfolio company, SALT Dental Partners (“SALT”), a specialty pediatric dentistry and orthodontic dental partner organization.

Led by Dylan Bates, Chief Executive Officer, 2023 was a transformational year for the Company and its partners. By year end, SALT executed 19 strategic partnerships, adding an impressive 40 locations and eight new states. This brought the Company’s year-end total to 90+ locations across 13 states. To support this growth, Mr. Bates’ has strategically built SALT’s leadership team, adding top talent across key support areas like operations, human resources, information technology, recruiting, marketing, procurement, financial planning & analysis as well as growth & development.

SALT also moved into its new Phoenix-based headquarters early in 2023, and has grown its support team substantially to provide top-tier services to doctor partners. To accommodate its planned growth trajectory, SALT will be looking to expand their square footage in the newly renovated Bond Phoenix where they are currently located.

“To execute on the market opportunity and ambitious growth goals we’ve set, it is imperative that we have the infrastructure to support our practices in a meaningful way,” says Bates. “We have significantly expanded our scope and scale. We have a highly skilled leadership team that has extensive experience in leading healthcare companies. Our teams are growing to support the needs of SALT practices now and into the future.”

Preserving and enhancing clinical leadership is core to SALT. Dr. Nick Raklios and Dr. Tony Paventy have taken on roles of Chief Pediatric Dental Officer and Chief Orthodontic Officer, respectively. Together, the two bring a high-level of clinical, chair side experience and operational expertise to the table. Additionally, SALT has launched a doctor leadership board that will ensure that clinical perspective and ground level support is at the forefront of all strategic initiatives and decisions. “The advisory board provides a vehicle to ensure the voice and perspective of doctors continues to be the primary focus of the organization, providing guidance to the executive leadership team that places the patient experience at the forefront of the Company,” says SALT Board Member, Dr. Mark Adams.

With the right support in place and a strong value proposition, SALT continues to execute on a patient-centered mission through thoughtful partnerships with blue-chip practices nationwide. Since the beginning of 2024, SALT has partnered with six outstanding practices with five additional partnerships anticipated to close by Q2 ’24, bringing SALT to 150+ locations nationwide. While SALT’s core focus remains in specialty pediatric dentistry and orthodontics, the Company has expanded into oral surgery with the first partnership closing in early March. “We are committed to partnering with the right specialty practices to create value, synergies, and economies of scale for our partners while promoting clinical excellence for the patients. With the right leadership team and support functions in place, SALT will continue to raise the bar for specialty dental care, nationwide,” says Bates.

SALT’s capital partner, Latticework Capital Management (“LCM”), continues to be excited and confident in the SALT team and its dedicated partner doctors. As SALT closed out a remarkable 2023, 2024 is set for continued transformational growth and scale. “We remain excited by the market opportunity within specialty pediatric dental as well as the team’s continued operational execution. With an intentional focus on providing exceptional support services to an engaged doctor base leading blue-chip practices nationwide, we believe SALT will continue to raise the bar in the DSO industry,” said Steve Neumann, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Latticework Capital Management.
