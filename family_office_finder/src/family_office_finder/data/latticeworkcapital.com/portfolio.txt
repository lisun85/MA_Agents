While LCM’s Founders were responsible for these investments, all such investments were supported by other personnel at these firms, some of whom held positions senior to LCM’s Founders, including the members of the respective firm’s investment committee who will not be members of Latticework’s investment committee or otherwise employed by Latticework.  Such differences may cause decisions made by LCM’s Founders on behalf of its previous firms to differ materially from decisions Latticework may make on behalf of the funds.
