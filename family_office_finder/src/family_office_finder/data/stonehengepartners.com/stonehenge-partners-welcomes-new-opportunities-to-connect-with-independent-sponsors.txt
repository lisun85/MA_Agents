Stonehenge Partners Welcomes New Opportunities to Connect with Independent Sponsors

Stonehenge Partners Overview

Stonehenge Partners is an Ohio‐based private equity firm that focuses exclusively on the lower middle market. Founded in 1999, we have a long history of partnering with leading entrepreneurs and managers who are focused on building winning teams, accelerating growth, and creating shareholder value. Across our funds, we have historically partnered with independent sponsors to provide flexible capital that meets the needs of all stakeholders, including majority equity, minority equity, debt, and combinations thereof. 

We raised our sixth institutional fund last year ($355M) and closed 6 transactions totaling $125M – of these opportunities, 3 were partnerships with independent sponsors. We understand and appreciate the value that independent sponsors provide as partners in transactions.
