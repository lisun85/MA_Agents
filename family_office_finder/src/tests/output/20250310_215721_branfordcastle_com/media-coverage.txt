Branford Forms New Filtration Platform

Branford’s Clean Solutions Group will consolidate its investments in Fibrix Filtration, acquired in August 2020, and its new acquisition of Americo

By John McNulty, February 9, 2022 – Branford Castle Partners has formed Clean Solutions Group (CSG) as a new platform to consolidate its ownership of Fibrix Filtration, acquired in August 2020, and its new acquisition of Americo Manufacturing Company. Branford acquired Americo from Blue Sage Capital which invested in the company in December 2017 in partnership with the founding Rones family.

Americo is a manufacturer of synthetic and natural fiber floor pads, hand pads, utility pads and floor matting. The company sources one hundred percent of its polyester fiber raw materials from recycled post-consumer and post-industrial waste. The company’s products are sold throughout the United States and worldwide in over 70 countries.

Americo was founded in 1969 as the American Manufacturing Company by Jim Rones. The company changed its name to Americo Manufacturing Company in 1984 and today is headquartered northwest of Atlanta in Acworth, Georgia.

Fibrix Filtration is a manufacturer of nonwoven filtration materials used in HVAC, paint collection, liquid, evaporative cooling, and specialty applications. Fibrix has more than 300 employees and operates 4 facilities – two in both Texas and North Carolina – with headquarters north of Charlotte in Mooresville, North Carolina. Fibrix is led by CEO Keith White who is also the president and CEO of Clean Solutions Group.

“The transition to a greener and cleaner environment is a monumental challenge for this generation,” said Mr. White. “The combination of Fibrix Filtration’s and Americo’s people, technologies, and assets creates a formidable nonwovens manufacturing platform focused on innovative clean solutions for home and work environments using environmentally sustainable practices.”

“We are enthusiastic to be joining Clean Solutions Group as we continue growing our business by delivering innovative, environmentally friendly products with an unparalleled customer experience,” said Lenny Shutzberg, the CEO of Americo. “The combination of these two great companies makes us stronger, more adaptable and better positioned to leverage our resources for sustainable, future growth.”

New York City-based Branford Castle invests in companies that have enterprise values of up to $100 million and EBITDA of less than $15 million. Sectors of interest include consumer products and services, commercial distribution, industrials and specialty manufacturing, business services, and logistics.

Byline Bank and Brookside Capital Partners provided financing to support the buy of Americo by Clean Solutions Group.

Branford Castle gallops ahead with winning transaction!

New York, October 1, 2021 – Branford Castle Partners announced that it has completed the sale of its portfolio company Pulse Veterinary Technologies to Zomedica Corp., for $70.9 million in an all-cash transaction.

PulseVet is the leading global manufacturer and supplier of veterinary shock wave therapy systems, stimulating enhanced healing of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, primarily for the performance horse market. The company is based in Alpharetta, GA, and sells worldwide. Notably, PulseVet recently launched a new companion-animal device, optimized for the treatment needs of dogs and cats. This takes the company’s growth prospects substantially beyond its historic equine market.

During Branford’s two-year ownership, PulseVet grew significantly via organic growth and two acquisitions. The first acquisition was NeoPulse, a leading Swiss-based shock wave therapy device manufacturer. The second acquisition brought in-house North American distribution of the NeoPulse line. During the past two years, PulseVet has also established advisory boards related to equine and small animal medicine, each with key opinion leaders in PulseVet’s industry.

“We greatly value the excellent partnership that we had with Branford,” said Adrian Lock, Founder and CEO of PulseVet. “It was a great “ride” and they were instrumental in helping us grow to our fullest potential, well beyond our initial expectations.”

Akerman LLP provided legal services and Cowen provided investment banking services to PulseVet.

Castle Harlan and Branford Castle Looking Great

Castle Harlan and Branford Castle Partners have acquired Sunless, a maker of spray tanning equipment and supplies, from The Riverside Company which acquired the company in July 2011.

Sunless is a manufacturer of spray tanning booths, airbrush equipment, proprietary tanning solutions, and professional-grade retail products used in the sunless tanning segment of the indoor tanning industry. Company-owned brands include MysticTan, VersaSpa and Norvell.

Sunless’ booths are installed in thousands of tanning salons, fitness clubs, beauty salons and other retail channels, and are responsible for more than 12 million spray tans per year. The company is also a leader in handheld spray tanning equipment and solutions used by airbrush artists to manually apply full-body spray tans.

Sunless is headquartered in Macedonia, OH (www.sunlessinc.com). “Spray tanning is quick, easy, and allows people to look awesome,” said John S. Castle, president and CEO of Branford Castle. “Branford’s deal team has been looking especially great since due diligence started. Further, we are very excited to work closely with the company’s customers to best address their needs and grow the industry as a whole.”

New York-based Branford Castle invests in companies that have enterprise values of up to $100 million and have from $1.5 million to $15 million of EBITDA. Sectors of interest include industrials, consumer goods & services and transportation & logistics industries. Between its founding in 1986 (by John K. Castle who also founded Castle Harlan) to 2016, Branford Castle operated as a family office. In October 2016, Branford Castle held a final close of its first fund that was open to outside investors and the investment in Sunless is the eleventh transaction for this fund.

In July 2016, Branford Castle invested in a similar company to Sunless when it acquired Earthlite, a Vista, CA-based manufacturer of massage tables, beauty and wellness equipment, supplies and accessories, oils and creams, manicure and pedicure equipment. The company’s most prominent products are its massage tables, which have an estimated 20% global market share.
“Sunless is an excellent opportunity to acquire the leader in a growing and recurring consumer market,” said Eric Schwartz, a managing director of Castle Harlan. “Demand for spray tanning is strong. It is amazing how quickly consumers who try spray tanning become regular adopters, and we expect this trend to continue in the coming years.”

Castle Harlan makes control investments in middle-market companies in North America, Europe and Australia. The firm has raised eight private equity funds – five in the United States and three in Australia – totaling more than $6 billion in capital commitments. Castle Harlan was founded in 1987 and is based in New York.

The Riverside Company, the seller of Sunless, is a global private equity firm focused on investing in and acquiring growing businesses valued at up to $400 million. Since its founding in 1988, Riverside has invested in more than 600 transactions and its portfolio includes more than 90 companies. The firm is headquartered in New York.

Announces Sale of Surface Preparation Technologies

New York, November 14 – Branford Castle Partners has sold its portfolio company Surface Preparation Technologies (“SPT”) to Dominus Capital. SPT is the nation’s number one provider of rumble strips and related roadway safety services. SPT has installed hundreds of thousands of miles of rumble strips, in almost every state, helping to keep motorists safely on the road and preventing head-on collisions. Branford acquired SPT in February of 2017. During Branford’s ownership period, SPT significantly expanded its geographic reach and fleet of proprietary equipment. In June of 2018, SPT acquired the rumble strip division of Diamond Surface Inc., which dramatically expanded its scale and ability to service customers on a national basis.

David Castle, Managing Partner for Branford, said, “We are delighted with the outcome. We believe SPT has been a highly successful investment for Branford and its limited partners.”

“In partnership with Branford, SPT has grown its operations to become a true national service provider.

Headquartered in Warsaw, IN, ABC is a niche market leading manufacturer and distributor of high-quality flexible ventilation solutions and technical fabrics.

Branford Castle Rumbles Again, Carving Out the Rumble Strip Division of Diamond Surface

Strengthens Its Leading Position As A Highway Safety Services Provider

New York, July 23 – Branford Castle Partners, the New York private equity firm, through its portfolio company Surface Preparation Technologies (SPT), has purchased the rumble-strip division of Diamond Surface, Inc.

These personnel and proprietary assets will be integrated with SPT’s existing operations under the ongoing leadership of SPT’s President and CEO, Steve Burke. SPT is the nation’s number one provider of rumble strips and related roadway safety services. SPT has cut over 175,000 miles of rumble strips, in almost every state, combating lane drift-off and preventing innumerable head-on highway crashes. The combined operations will significantly enhance national equipment availability and responsiveness. In conjunction with the acquisition, SPT completed a full recapitalization.

Proprietary equipment enables SPT to perform high-speed installation of these life-saving safety devices on concrete or asphalt roadways. Rumble strips are a proven, cost-efficient means to keep travelers safer by reducing crossover risks and run-off traffic accidents. The combined SPT business also offers a unique, quieter “sinus” rumble strip option for certain areas where roadside noise may be a concern. In the world of autonomous-friendly infrastructure, rumble strips also provide valuable functionality – both for high detection by lane departure technology and as a system fail-safe due to the near-permanence of the rumble strip.

Terms of the current transaction were not disclosed.

Branford Castle Invests in Titan Production Equipment

5th Platform Transaction For Late 2016 Vintage Fund

NEW YORK, June 29 – Branford Castle Partners, the New York private equity firm, has made a significant investment in Titan Production Equipment, a leading manufacturer of oil and gas production equipment. Titan is a carve-out of the North American oil and gas production equipment assets of Exterran Corp. (NYSE: EXTN)

Titan is the fifth platform acquisition for the Branford Castle Fund, which had its final close in October 2016. “While we have been investing for 30 years, Branford has grown rapidly since forming our first institutional fund a little over a year ago,” said John S. Castle, President and CEO of Branford Castle Partners. “We are committed to generating superior returns for our investors by making disciplined investments and working alongside management teams to further develop great companies.”

Titan is a market leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of oil and gas production equipment used to separate, process and treat hydrocarbon streams at the wellhead, gathering and processing stages of production. Former and current managers of Titan’s operations under Exterran, led by CEO Chris Werner and Senior Vice President Michael Collins, are investors in Titan and will operate the new business going forward. Titan is differentiated by its strong in-house design and engineering capabilities and its ability to produce and deliver high volumes of large, complex and customized products.

“Titan is Branford’s second platform acquisition this month. We continue to move rapidly to deploy investors’ capital to grow our portfolio of dynamic companies,” said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. “Titan is a particularly attractive investment because of the recent recovery of North American oil and gas drilling activity and the need for Titan’s equipment in its markets. As part of the transaction, Titan will become Exterran’s preferred supplier of production equipment for its U.S. and Canadian operations.”

Werner said, “Exterran’s production business developed a powerful market reputation over the years, largely because of the strong local workforce in Columbus, Texas. We are going to maintain this continuity in both labor and experience as the business escalates production.”

The purchase of Titan follows Branford’s acquisition of:

Drew Foam Companies, Inc., a leading provider of custom-fabricated expanded polystyrene foam (“EPS”) products serving the packaging, building products and consumer end-markets, primarily in the Southeastern United States;
Vitrek, a leading manufacturer of sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment;
Surface Preparation Technologies, the leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety;
Earthlite Massage Tables, the world’s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and
Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.

Terms of the Titan transaction were not disclosed. Castle Harlan, Inc., the New York private equity and investment firm, arranged and managed the transaction, which was first announced in April 2018.

Branford Castle Acquires Drew Foam Companies, Inc.

Southeast regional leading fabricator of foam packaging and building products

New York, June 4, 2018 – Branford Castle, a New York-based private equity firm, today announced the acquisition of Drew Foam Companies, Inc., a leading provider of custom-fabricated expanded polystyrene foam (“EPS”) products serving the packaging, building products and consumer end-markets, primarily in the Southeastern United States. The acquisition is the 5th for the Branford Castle Fund which had its final close in late 2016.

Headquartered in Monticello, Arkansas, the company has three operating facilities, in Monticello, Portland, Tennessee, and Anderson, South Carolina. The company, founded in 1965, offers quick turnaround for customers who often demand just-in-time (“JIT”) delivery for products. Most competing EPS suppliers require long production (high-volume) runs to create manufacturing efficiencies. Drew offers customers flexibility. It processes more than 100 different orders per day, with an estimated 80% of its orders manufactured and shipped on company trucks within 24 hours of receipt and 95% shipped within 48 hours. Drew has more than 700 customers, with no single customer accounting for more than 5% of sales, and its customer retention rate is in excess of 97%.

“Drew’s logistical capabilities and ability to deliver low-volume custom products on a just-in-time basis are unique competitive advantages,” said John S. Castle, President and CEO, of Branford Castle Partners. “We are looking forward to enhancing the company’s packaging-industry growth, extending its customer base, innovating new products and entering new regions.”

The purchase of Drew follows Branford’s acquisition of Vitrek, a leading manufacturer of sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment; Surface Preparation Technologies, the leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety; Earthlite Massage Tables, the world’s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.

Branford Castle was advised by its legal counsel, Akerman LLP. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. TCF Capital Funding provided senior debt financing and Siguler Guff & Company, LP provided mezzanine debt financing and made an equity co-investment for the transaction.

Branford Castle Acquires Vitrek, LLC

Southeast regional leading fabricator of foam packaging and building products

New York, January 9, 2018 – Branford Castle, a New York-based private equity firm, today announced the acquisition of Vitrek, LLC, a leading manufacturer of highly sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment based near San Diego, CA. The acquisition is the fourth for its fund that closed in late 2016.

“We are moving rapidly to deploy our investors’ capital, and Vitrek represents an exciting growth opportunity,” said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. “We are especially pleased to be partnering again with Don Millstein, who is taking over as Operating Executive and Chairman of Vitrek. Don previously partnered with Branford Castle as President of E-Mon, a leading manufacturer of electrical sub-metering equipment that Branford sold for an 11x return.”

The transaction follows Branford’s acquisition of Surface Preparation Technologies, the United States’ leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety, Earthlite Massage Tables, the world’s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries, and Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.

Vitrek, founded in 1990, is known for its line of high potential (hipot) testers, high voltage meters and power analyzers. These products measure electrical safety, power consumption, and other characteristics of electricity in the context of the development, testing and manufacture of a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. Vitrek has significant US market share with most of its competitors manufacturing overseas.

Kevin Clark, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vitrek, said the company serves a diverse group of customers, including premier brands in the electrical, electronics, medical, cable, power, lighting and consumer appliance sectors. “Customers use our equipment to test their electrical products during the development stage and also in mass production. Vitrek’s power analyzers aid design engineers in improving the power efficiency of their products. At the mass production stage, Vitrek’s electrical safety testers confirm that end-users will be protected from “electrical shock” when using that product,” he said.

Millstein has created a strategic plan to grow Vitrek through multiple avenues. “We plan to establish a comprehensive sales and marketing program to begin to access or further penetrate growth markets and to formalize OEM program opportunities,” he said. “We also want to expand the product line and launch an electronic component distribution program.” Millstein will take over as CEO when Clark retires after an appropriate transition period.

Led by John S. Castle and David Castle, Branford Castle is a recently formed lower-middle market investment fund. Between 1986 and 2016, Branford operated as an award-winning family office. Building from its significant investment successes, Branford recently raised its first fund open to outside investors. With each new investment, Branford builds on its 30+ year history of helping to grow businesses. The firm typically makes control investments in companies with less than $15 million of EBITDA and a leadership position in a niche industry. Branford is particularly keen on the strong relationships it develops with its portfolio company managers.

Branford has particular expertise in consumer products and services, commercial distribution, business services and logistics. Branford also brings the expertise from its affiliation with the management at the leading middle-market investment firm Castle Harlan.

Lunch with John S. Castle

Published in PE HUB WIRE

Salad dominated my first lunch with John S. Castle, a managing partner of Branford Castle Partners. “The lines are out the door,” said Castle, who had to push his way through a crowd of people to meet me.

Why were a group of well-dressed executives queued up outside in the heat Monday? To buy a salad. I won’t disclose which fast food chain it was. Castle and I tallied up the various salad-related establishments that are seemingly gobbling up Manhattan. There’s Just Salad, sweetgreen, Essen Slow Fast Food and, of course, Chop’t. I confessed I’m a Just Salad member.

Castle, who said he has no vested interest in salad, said it was Chop’t that started the craze. He wondered if the lines outside were really just a matter of getting customers out the door faster. “It’s clear that [Chop’t] created a real category here. This is just an observation,” he said.

For lunch, since we were focused on it, we both had chopped salads (but not from Chop’t). We finally talked about what we were meant to discuss: Branford Castle Partners, the former family office that chose in 2015 to morph into a private equity firm. Castle, who joined in 2002, said the firm decided to make the switch because it “wanted more.”

The GP combined its own money, along with family office and institutional funding, to raise its first pool. In October, Branford Castle Partners announced the final close of its $116 million debut fund. “We wanted to take the next step,” Castle said of the switch to PE. “We wanted more.”

The lower-middle-market PE firm, a generalist investor, has done two deals so far: Surface Preparation Technologies in February and Earthlite Massage Tables last year. Branford Castle Partners will invest up to $20 million to $25 million in companies with EBITDA between $1.5 million and $15 million.

The biggest difference between a family office and a PE firm? You have to put money to work, said Castle.

Castle wouldn’t say if he was interested in investing in a salad chain.

Branford Castle Acquires Surface Preparation Technologies

The nation’s leading provider of rumble strips

Branford Castle Partners, L.P. (“Branford Castle”), a New York City-based private equity firm, today announced that its affiliate has purchased Surface Preparation Technologies, LLC (“SPT”), the nation’s leading provider of rumble strips and related roadway safety services. The existing SPT management team invested in the transaction alongside Branford Castle’s affiliate Fund and will continue to lead the company.

“Rumble strips are vital highway and roadway safety features that alert inattentive drivers of potential danger, and are a proven and cost-efficient measure to keep travelers safer by reducing the risks of crossover and run-off traffic accidents,” said Steve Burke, CEO of SPT.

Based in Mechanicsburg, PA, SPT has garnered its leading market position through a unique combination of roadway infrastructure expertise and its extensive fleet of proprietary equipment. SPT designs and manufactures its high-performance, patented rumble strip machines, or “mills”. SPT’s mills run significantly faster and are more durable than competitors’ machines. (www.rumblestrips.com)

The Company, founded in 1988, is considered a pioneer in the roadway safety industry and has installed more than 150,000 miles of rumble strips across 49 states. The ultimate customer for SPT’s services is typically a state’s Department of Transportation.

Branford Castle was advised by its legal counsel, Akerman LLP. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
