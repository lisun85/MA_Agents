For deals that are completed, we pay 4% of total cash transaction value for proprietary introductions and a Standard Lehman for non-proprietary introductions. For deals that (unfortunately) don\u2019t get done, we pay 25,000-50,000 Frequent Flyer airline miles if we submit an Indication of Interest or a Letter of Intent. Branford has been one of the most active private equity firms focused on manufacturing, industrials, and services businesses between $2MM-15MM EBITDA across North America.

Letters of Intent are more formal and detailed thoughts outlining a potential transaction. Such letters are usually submitted after we have had an initial meeting with management and reviewed a dataroom. Letters of intent are typically, in most respects, non-binding and subject to the completion of definitive documentation and other conditions. Branford shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a given letter qualifies as an expression of interest or letter of intent, and whether a given opportunity qualifies as proprietary or non-proprietary. Miles will be awarded for the highest level (IOI or LOI) achieved in a specific deal such that only 25,000 or 50,000 miles will be awarded for a given deal. This program will apply to the first three deals brought to Branford Castle by any single intermediary. Recipient must be in compliance with all confidentiality requirements of the target company. This program is subject to the terms and conditions of each airline\u2019s frequent flyer program.\n\n*Remuneration shall only be payable to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law as in effect from time to time as reasonably determined by the provider of such remuneration. As a condition precedent to receiving remuneration with respect to proprietary deals, non-proprietary deals or non-completed deals, a person: (a) must execute, at the time the deal is presented to us, Branford Castle\u2019s standard referral fee agreement and prove compliance with law with respect to the payment of such remuneration or otherwise; and (b) shall be deemed to have represented and warranted to the provider of such remuneration and its affiliates that the payment of such remuneration is so in compliance with applicable law (because the recipient is (i) a registered broker-dealer as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), (ii) is an M&A Broker, as such term is defined in Act or that certain SEC No-Action Letter dated January 31, 2014 re: M&A Brokers (the \u201cBroker Letter\u201d) and will satisfy all of the requirements set forth in the Broker Letter and otherwise to avoid enforcement by the SEC in connection to his, her or its failure to register with the SEC as a broker-dealer or (iii) has a valid exemption from registering as a broker-dealer with the SEC.) This program applies to opportunities shared with Branford Castle prior to December 31, 2025 and acquired by Branford or another affiliated party within 90 days of the termination of the program. This program may be terminated or amended by Branford Castle Partners at any time without notice. The program may be extended at the discretion of Branford Castle.\n\nBranford reserves the right to cancel the program at any time.",
