      "content": "ABOUT US\nPREFERRED BUYER OF\u00a0MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES\nLEADERSHIP\nEric J. Mara | CEO\nEric is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Right Lane Industries LLC. Prior to founding Right Lane, Eric was a junior partner at a research-driven, long/short equity hedge fund formed to deploy private equity-like due diligence to public markets investing. Eric began his career as a member of the private equity deal team at Audax Group.\n\nMr. Mara received a BSBA,\u00a0Magna Cum Laude, from Babson College, and resides in Coral Gables, FL with his wife and daughters.\n\nWhy Right Lane?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are often asked why we named our firm Right Lane,\u00a0which is commonly associated with the slow lane on a highway. Drivers seeking the fastest route through traffic conventionally seek out the 'fast' left lane, or attempt to swerve through traffic to gain an advantage. But in high traffic settings, the left lane invariably\u00a0becomes over-crowded, with more cars in the lane\u00a0resulting in more starts and stops,\u00a0and slower progress; while frequent lane switching can result\u00a0in accidents or bad bets. Meanwhile, the right lane tends to suffer from net outflows of cars as drivers pull into the perceived faster lanes, or exit the highway altogether, and therefore offers the fastest and smoothest route.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting is a high traffic setting. The pursuit of investment returns is competitive. While many investors attempt to generate returns\u00a0by chasing the\u00a0popular investment of the day\u00a0(the financial equivalent of the left lane), or by making large numbers of trades\u00a0(weaving through lanes), Right lane focuses on overlooked\u00a0or complicated situations that other investors often regard as\u00a0\"too difficult.\" We conduct deep due diligence and make a small number of investments with conviction, with the intent of staying\u00a0invested for extended periods of time (longer than a traditional private equity investment horizon of 3-5 years). We expect our strategy will result in significant wealth creation for our investors and management teams.\n\nHome\nAbout Us\nInvestment Criteria\nInvestments\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nRIGHT LANE CAPITAL LLC\n2601 SOUTH BAYSHORE DRIVE SUITE 725\n\n\u00a0COCONUT GROVE, FL 33133\n\nCopyright \u00a9\u00a0Right Lane Capital LLC.
