Since 2018, we have been investing exclusively out of our affiliate Right Lane Industries LLC, an industrial holding company offering a stable home to lower middle market industrial businesses that have been orphaned inside larger companies, or that are undergoing a period of underperformance for which prior ownership or their creditors are not capable of addressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur transactions - which often involve a heightened level of complexity - are designed to provide attractive solutions to sellers, whether they are large corporates seeking to divest a non-core division, or the owners and creditors of an underperforming business seeking liquidity or recovery. At the same time, we seek to create a stable and prudently capitalized environment from which our companies can grow into world class, competitive organizations. Our companies are operated by autonomous management teams who are heavily aligned with Right Lane, and who share significantly in the wealth creation of our investments.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9\u00a0Right Lane Capital LLC.
