    "content": "Headquartered in New York City, Branford is a pre-eminent private market investor. We are focused on working with already strong companies that typically have under $100MM in sales. Since Branford\u2019s founding in 1986, our mission has been to work with these companies to maximize their potential, both in terms of strengthening operations and facilitating growth.\nAs evidence of the success of our partnership with companies, two recent managers of our businesses made 30-45x their invested capital during Branford\u2019s ownership period when we sold the companies.*\nIn the investment world, there are few organizations more experienced and qualified to work with private companies. The Branford team is made up of highly regarded individuals with significant investing experience. For the past 15 years, Branford has been led by John S. Castle and David Castle.\nBranford\u2019s team is rounded-out with highly skilled and professional investors and operators, who understand that carefully listening to the needs of entrepreneurs and management teams is crucial to recognizing the distinct needs of a business and helping it to achieve enduring success.\nBranford\u2019s investing experience makes it a world-class partner both in closing a transaction and in helping to build businesses:\n\nTRANSACTION EXPERIENCE\nOur principals have closed hundreds of private market transactions, some as large as $1 billion in transaction value.\n\nTRANSACTION STRUCTURING\nBranford typically requires a control stake in a business post-transaction, but encourages management teams and prior owners to re-invest equity in the company and can structure highly tailored and flexible transactions to meet the needs of all involved in the deal.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO THE BUSINESS\nBranford spends a significant amount of time post-transaction working with portfolio company executives to augment the existing operations and to grow the business to new heights.\n\nOPERATING EXPERIENCE\nGiven the hundreds of companies our principals have worked with, we have accumulated an exceptional amount of knowledge in terms of helping companies grow. We recognize that the first thing to do is to listen to the experience and the histories of the executives and owners who have first-hand experience running the business.\n\nBRANFORD PHILOSOPHY\n\nBranford believes that a good partnership is good business. That core belief underlies everything we do at Branford, from our collaborative style to the close relationships we build with our portfolio company management teams. Much of our success can be credited to our record of being good listeners who respect transparency and believe in strong corporate governance policies.\n\nWe are highly supportive partners of our management teams. We believe the most successful opportunities are created by strong management teams who respond positively to operating autonomy and meaningful equity ownership. We work closely with management to create long-term value by identifying value-drivers that can improve a company\u2019s performance, and we create generous, performance-based incentives that align management with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe combination of an experienced, motivated management team with Branford\u2019s financial, strategic and operating experience, expertise, and sophistication has consistently served to enhance the value of Branford\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\n*\u00a0Returns are for portfolio company managers and include investments and incentives. These returns do not necessarily reflect the returns of Branford Castle Partners or its investing affiliates.\n\nManagement Team\nJOHN S. CASTLE\nPRESIDENT & CEO\nDAVID CASTLE\nMANAGING PARTNER\nERIC KORSTEN\nSENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR\nCEON FRANCIS\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\nJAMES REDDINGTON\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\nMARILYN YANG\nPRINCIPAL"
