      "content": "Headquartered in New York City, Branford is a pre-eminent private market investor. We are focused on working with already strong companies that typically have under $100MM in sales. Since Branford\u2019s founding in 1986, our mission has been to work with these companies to maximize their potential, both in terms of strengthening operations and facilitating growth.\nAs evidence of the success of our partnership with companies, two recent managers of our businesses made 30-45x their invested capital during Branford\u2019s ownership period when we sold the companies.*\nIn the investment world, there are few organizations more experienced and qualified to work with private companies. The Branford team is made up of highly regarded individuals with significant investing experience. For the past 15 years, Branford has been led by John S. Castle and David Castle.\nBranford\u2019s team is rounded-out with highly skilled and professional investors and operators, who understand that carefully listening to the needs of entrepreneurs and management teams is crucial to recognizing the distinct needs of a business and helping it to achieve enduring success.\nBranford\u2019s investing experience makes it a world-class partner both in closing a transaction and in helping to build businesses:\n\nTRANSACTION EXPERIENCE\nOur principals have closed hundreds of private market transactions, some as large as $1 billion in transaction value.\n\nTRANSACTION STRUCTURING\nBranford typically requires a control stake in a business post-transaction, but encourages management teams and prior owners to re-invest equity in the company and can structure highly tailored and flexible transactions to meet the needs of all involved in the deal.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO THE BUSINESS\nBranford spends a significant amount of time post-transaction working with portfolio company executives to augment the existing operations and to grow the business to new heights.\n\nOPERATING EXPERIENCE\nGiven the hundreds of companies our principals have worked with, we have accumulated an exceptional amount of knowledge in terms of helping companies grow. We recognize that the first thing to do is to listen to the experience and the histories of the executives and owners who have first-hand experience running the business.\n\nBRANFORD PHILOSOPHY\n\nBranford believes that a good partnership is good business. That core belief underlies everything we do at Branford, from our collaborative style to the close relationships we build with our portfolio company management teams. Much of our success can be credited to our record of being good listeners who respect transparency and believe in strong corporate governance policies.\n\nWe are highly supportive partners of our management teams. We believe the most successful opportunities are created by strong management teams who respond positively to operating autonomy and meaningful equity ownership. We work closely with management to create long-term value by identifying value-drivers that can improve a company\u2019s performance, and we create generous, performance-based incentives that align management with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe combination of an experienced, motivated management team with Branford\u2019s financial, strategic and operating experience, expertise, and sophistication has consistently served to enhance the value of Branford\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\n*\u00a0Returns are for portfolio company managers and include investments and incentives. These returns do not necessarily reflect the returns of Branford Castle Partners or its investing affiliates.\n\nManagement Team\nJOHN S.

      "content": "Branford is a leader in paying referral fees and airline miles for deals that are brought to us. For deals that are completed, we pay 4% of total cash transaction value for proprietary introductions and a Standard Lehman for non-proprietary introductions. For deals that (unfortunately) don\u2019t get done, we pay 25,000-50,000 Frequent Flyer airline miles if we submit an Indication of Interest or a Letter of Intent. Branford has been one of the most active private equity firms focused on manufacturing, industrials, and services businesses between $2MM-15MM EBITDA across North America. Please contact Eric Korsten at ekorsten@branfordcastle.com with any questions or for more information.\nPROPRIETARY DEALS\nBranford will pay 4% of total transaction value if we close on a proprietary deal that you send us.*\nFor example, deals of the following transaction value would result in the following fee:\n\n$10MM\n$400,000\n\n$30MM\n$1.2MM\n$50MM\n$2.0MM\n$70MM\n$2.8MM\n\n$90MM\n$3.6MM\n\n$110MM\n$4.4MM\n\n$130MM\n$5.2MM\n\n$150MM\n$6MM\n\nNON-PROPRIETARY DEALS\nBranford will pay a referral fee if we close on a deal that you send us.\nCompleted deals will result in the following fees paid:\nA \"LEHMAN\" FORMULA\n5% for the first $1MM in Transaction Value\n4% for the second $1MM\n3% for the third $1MM\n2% for the fourth $1MM\n1% thereafter\nFor example, deals of the following transaction value would result in the following fee:\n$10MM\n$200,000\n$30MM\n$400,000\n$50MM\n$600,000\n$70MM\n$800,000\n\n$90MM\n$1MM\n\n$110MM\n$1.2MM\n\n$130MM\n$1.4MM\n\n$150MM\n$1.6MM\n\nNON-COMPLETED DEALS*\nPlus, take yourself and/or your family on a vacation using frequent flyer miles.\n\nBranford submits a Letter of intent for adeal that you send to us.\n\n50,000 miles\n\nBranford submits an\nIndication of\nInterest for a deal that you send to us.\n\n25,000 miles\n\n*Expressions of Interest are preliminary and non-binding indications of our potential interest in an opportunity, typically submitted prior to our initial management meeting. Letters of Intent are more formal and detailed thoughts outlining a potential transaction. Such letters are usually submitted after we have had an initial meeting with management and reviewed a dataroom. Letters of intent are typically, in most respects, non-binding and subject to the completion of definitive documentation and other conditions. Branford shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a given letter qualifies as an expression of interest or letter of intent, and whether a given opportunity qualifies as proprietary or non-proprietary. Miles will be awarded for the highest level (IOI or LOI) achieved in a specific deal such that only 25,000 or 50,000 miles will be awarded for a given deal. This program will apply to the first three deals brought to Branford Castle by any single intermediary. Recipient must be in compliance with all confidentiality requirements of the target company. This program is subject to the terms and conditions of each airline\u2019s frequent flyer program.\n\n*Remuneration shall only be payable to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law as in effect from time to time as reasonably determined by the provider of such remuneration. As a condition precedent to receiving remuneration with respect to proprietary deals, non-proprietary deals or non-completed deals, a person: (a) must execute, at the time the deal is presented to us, Branford Castle\u2019s standard referral fee agreement and prove compliance with law with respect to the payment of such remuneration or otherwise; and (b) shall be deemed to have represented and warranted to the provider of such remuneration and its affiliates that the payment of such remuneration is so in compliance with applicable law (because the recipient is (i) a registered broker-dealer as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), (ii) is an M&A Broker, as such term is defined in Act or that certain SEC No-Action Letter dated January 31, 2014 re: M&A Brokers (the \u201cBroker Letter\u201d) and will satisfy all of the requirements set forth in the Broker Letter and otherwise to avoid enforcement by the SEC in connection to his, her or its failure to register with the SEC as a broker-dealer or (iii) has a valid exemption from registering as a broker-dealer with the SEC.) This program applies to opportunities shared with Branford Castle prior to December 31, 2025 and acquired by Branford or another affiliated party within 90 days of the termination of the program. This program may be terminated or amended by Branford Castle Partners at any time without notice. The program may be extended at the discretion of Branford Castle.\n\nBranford reserves the right to cancel the program at any time."

Titan is a carve-out of the North American oil and gas production equipment assets of Exterran Corp. (NYSE: EXTN)\n\nTitan is the fifth platform acquisition for the Branford Castle Fund, which had its final close in October 2016. \u201cWhile we have been investing for 30 years, Branford has grown rapidly since forming our first institutional fund a little over a year ago,\u201d said John S. Castle, President and CEO of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cWe are committed to generating superior returns for our investors by making disciplined investments and working alongside management teams to further develop great companies.\u201d\n\nTitan is a market leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of oil and gas production equipment used to separate, process and treat hydrocarbon streams at the wellhead, gathering and processing stages of production. Former and current managers of Titan\u2019s operations under Exterran, led by CEO Chris Werner and Senior Vice President Michael Collins, are investors in Titan and will operate the new business going forward. Titan is differentiated by its strong in-house design and engineering capabilities and its ability to produce and deliver high volumes of large, complex and customized products.\n\n\u201cTitan is Branford\u2019s second platform acquisition this month. We continue to move rapidly to deploy investors\u2019 capital to grow our portfolio of dynamic companies,\u201d said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cTitan is a particularly attractive investment because of the recent recovery of North American oil and gas drilling activity and the need for Titan\u2019s equipment in its markets. As part of the transaction, Titan will become Exterran\u2019s preferred supplier of production equipment for its U.S. and Canadian operations.\u201d\n\nWerner said, \u201cExterran\u2019s production business developed a powerful market reputation over the years, largely because of the strong local workforce in Columbus, Texas. We are going to maintain this continuity in both labor and experience as the business escalates production.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of Titan follows Branford\u2019s acquisition of:\n\nDrew Foam Companies, Inc., a leading provider of custom-fabricated expanded polystyrene foam (\u201cEPS\u201d) products serving the packaging, building products and consumer end-markets, primarily in the Southeastern United States;\nVitrek, a leading manufacturer of sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment;\nSurface Preparation Technologies, the leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety;\nEarthlite Massage Tables, the world\u2019s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and\nContinuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.\n\nTerms of the Titan transaction were not disclosed.

The acquisition is the 5th for the Branford Castle Fund which had its final close in late 2016.\n\nHeadquartered in Monticello, Arkansas, the company has three operating facilities, in Monticello, Portland, Tennessee, and Anderson, South Carolina. The company, founded in 1965, offers quick turnaround for customers who often demand just-in-time (\u201cJIT\u201d) delivery for products. Most competing EPS suppliers require long production (high-volume) runs to create manufacturing efficiencies. Drew offers customers flexibility. It processes more than 100 different orders per day, with an estimated 80% of its orders manufactured and shipped on company trucks within 24 hours of receipt and 95% shipped within 48 hours. Drew has more than 700 customers, with no single customer accounting for more than 5% of sales, and its customer retention rate is in excess of 97%.\n\n\u201cDrew\u2019s logistical capabilities and ability to deliver low-volume custom products on a just-in-time basis are unique competitive advantages,\u201d said John S. Castle, President and CEO, of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cWe are looking forward to enhancing the company\u2019s packaging-industry growth, extending its customer base, innovating new products and entering new regions.\u201d\n\nThe purchase of Drew follows Branford\u2019s acquisition of Vitrek, a leading manufacturer of sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment; Surface Preparation Technologies, the leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety; Earthlite Massage Tables, the world\u2019s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries; and Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.\n\nBranford Castle was advised by its legal counsel, Akerman LLP. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. TCF Capital Funding provided senior debt financing and Siguler Guff & Company, LP provided mezzanine debt financing and made an equity co-investment for the transaction.\n\nJanuary 9, 2018\n\nBranford Castle Acquires Vitrek, LLC\n\nSoutheast regional leading fabricator of foam packaging and building products\n\nNew York, January 9, 2018 \u2013 Branford Castle, a New York-based private equity firm, today announced the acquisition of Vitrek, LLC, a leading manufacturer of highly sophisticated electrical safety test and measurement equipment based near San Diego, CA. The acquisition is the fourth for its fund that closed in late 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are moving rapidly to deploy our investors\u2019 capital, and Vitrek represents an exciting growth opportunity,\u201d said David Castle, Managing Partner of Branford Castle Partners. \u201cWe are especially pleased to be partnering again with Don Millstein, who is taking over as Operating Executive and Chairman of Vitrek. Don previously partnered with Branford Castle as President of E-Mon, a leading manufacturer of electrical sub-metering equipment that Branford sold for an 11x return.\u201d\n\nThe transaction follows Branford\u2019s acquisition of Surface Preparation Technologies, the United States\u2019 leader in cutting rumble strips for roadway safety, Earthlite Massage Tables, the world\u2019s No. 1 brand of products for the spa, massage and wellness industries, and Continuum Foot Spas, LLC, a leader in the premium pedicure chair market and a highly complementary bolt-on acquisition for Earthlite.\n\nVitrek, founded in 1990, is known for its line of high potential (hipot) testers, high voltage meters and power analyzers. These products measure electrical safety, power consumption, and other characteristics of electricity in the context of the development, testing and manufacture of a wide variety of consumer and industrial products. Vitrek has significant US market share with most of its competitors manufacturing overseas.\n\nKevin Clark, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vitrek, said the company serves a diverse group of customers, including premier brands in the electrical, electronics, medical, cable, power, lighting and consumer appliance sectors. \u201cCustomers use our equipment to test their electrical products during the development stage and also in mass production. Vitrek\u2019s power analyzers aid design engineers in improving the power efficiency of their products. At the mass production stage, Vitrek\u2019s electrical safety testers confirm that end-users will be protected from \u201celectrical shock\u201d when using that product,\u201d he said.\n\nMillstein has created a strategic plan to grow Vitrek through multiple avenues. \u201cWe plan to establish a comprehensive sales and marketing program to begin to access or further penetrate growth markets and to formalize OEM program opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to expand the product line and launch an electronic component distribution program.\u201d Millstein will take over as CEO when Clark retires after an appropriate transition period.\n\nLed by John S. Castle and David Castle, Branford Castle is a recently formed lower-middle market investment fund. Between 1986 and 2016, Branford operated as an award-winning family office. Building from its significant investment successes, Branford recently raised its first fund open to outside investors. With each new investment, Branford builds on its 30+ year history of helping to grow businesses. The firm typically makes control investments in companies with less than $15 million of EBITDA and a leadership position in a niche industry. Branford is particularly keen on the strong relationships it develops with its portfolio company managers.\n\nBranford has particular expertise in consumer products and services, commercial distribution, business services and logistics. Branford also brings the expertise from its affiliation with the management at the leading middle-market investment firm Castle Harlan.\n\nFor more information,\u00a0contact us.\n\nManagement Team\nJOHN S.

Castle\n\nPublished in PE HUB WIRE\n\nSalad dominated my first lunch with\u00a0John S. Castle, a managing partner of\u00a0Branford Castle Partners. \u201cThe lines are out the door,\u201d said Castle, who had to push his way through a crowd of people to meet me.\n\nWhy were a group of well-dressed executives queued up outside in the heat Monday? To buy a salad. I won\u2019t disclose which fast food chain it was. Castle and I tallied up the various salad-related establishments that are seemingly gobbling up Manhattan. There\u2019s\u00a0Just Salad,\u00a0sweetgreen,\u00a0Essen Slow Fast Food\u00a0and, of course,\u00a0Chop\u2019t. I confessed I\u2019m a Just Salad member.\n\nCastle, who said he has no vested interest in salad, said it was Chop\u2019t that started the craze. He wondered if the lines outside were really just a matter of getting customers out the door faster. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Chop\u2019t] created a real category here. This is just an observation,\u201d he said.\n\nFor lunch, since we were focused on it, we both had chopped salads (but not from Chop\u2019t). We finally talked about what we were meant to discuss: Branford Castle Partners, the former family office that chose in 2015 to morph into a private equity firm. Castle, who joined in 2002, said the firm decided to make the switch because it \u201cwanted more.\u201d\n\nThe GP combined its own money, along with family office and institutional funding, to raise its first pool. In October, Branford Castle Partners announced the final close of its $116 million debut fund. \u201cWe wanted to take the next step,\u201d Castle said of the switch to PE. \u201cWe wanted more.\u201d\n\nThe lower-middle-market PE firm, a generalist investor, has done two deals so far:\u00a0Surface Preparation Technologies\u00a0in February and\u00a0Earthlite Massage Tables\u00a0last year. Branford Castle Partners will invest up to $20 million to $25 million in companies with EBITDA between $1.5 million and $15 million.\n\nThe biggest difference between a family office and a PE firm? You have to put money to work, said Castle.\n\nCastle wouldn\u2019t say if he was interested in investing in a salad chain.\n\nSeptember 14, 2017\n\nBranford Castle\u2019s Portfolio Company Earthlite Acquires Continuum Footspas\n\nNew York, September 11, 2017 \u2013 Branford Castle Partners, LP (\u201cBranford Castle\u201d), a New York City-based private equity firm, today announced that its portfolio company, Earthlite LLC (\u201cEarthlite\u201d), has acquired Continuum Footspas, LLC (\u201cContinuum\u201d) from Joe Galati and the other founders of the company.\n\nBased in New Berlin, WI, Continuum is a leader in the premium pedicure chair market. The Company\u2019s end-customers include many international luxury hotel chains and high-end day spas. Continuum was founded by the inventors of the modern pedicure chair.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to add this leading brand to Earthlite\u2019s already strong pedicure product offering,\u201d said Earthlite CEO, Jim Chenevey. \u201cWe have long admired Continuum\u2019s quality products and reputation for excellent service, and look forward to continuing to build this great brand.\u201d\n\nBranford Castle was advised by its legal counsel, Akerman LLP. TCF Capital Funding provided financing for the transaction, with the company\u2019s mezzanine lender Siguler Guff supporting the transaction as well. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nFebruary 16, 2017\n\nBranford Castle Acquires Surface Preparation Technologies\n\nThe nation\u2019s leading provider of rumble strips\n\nBranford Castle Partners, L.P. (\u201cBranford Castle\u201d), a New York City-based private equity firm, today announced that its affiliate has purchased Surface Preparation Technologies, LLC (\u201cSPT\u201d), the nation\u2019s leading provider of rumble strips and related roadway safety services. The existing SPT management team invested in the transaction alongside Branford Castle\u2019s affiliate Fund and will continue to lead the company.\n\n\u201cRumble strips are vital highway and roadway safety features that alert inattentive drivers of potential danger, and are a proven and cost-efficient measure to keep travelers safer by reducing the risks of crossover and run-off traffic accidents,\u201d said Steve Burke, CEO of SPT.\n\nBased in Mechanicsburg, PA, SPT has garnered its leading market position through a unique combination of roadway infrastructure expertise and its extensive fleet of proprietary equipment. SPT designs and manufactures its high-performance, patented rumble strip machines, or \u201cmills\u201d. SPT\u2019s mills run significantly faster and are more durable than competitors\u2019 machines. (www.rumblestrips.com)\n\nThe Company, founded in 1988, is considered a pioneer in the roadway safety industry and has installed more than 150,000 miles of rumble strips across 49 states. The ultimate customer for SPT\u2019s services is typically a state\u2019s Department of Transportation.\n\nBranford Castle was advised by its legal counsel, Akerman LLP.

      "content": "Headquartered in New York City, Branford is a pre-eminent private market investor. We are focused on working with already strong companies that typically have under $100MM in sales. Since Branford\u2019s founding in 1986, our mission has been to work with these companies to maximize their potential, both in terms of strengthening operations and facilitating growth.\nAs evidence of the success of our partnership with companies, two recent managers of our businesses made 30-45x their invested capital during Branford\u2019s ownership period when we sold the companies.*\nIn the investment world, there are few organizations more experienced and qualified to work with private companies. The Branford team is made up of highly regarded individuals with significant investing experience. For the past 15 years, Branford has been led by John S. Castle and David Castle.\nBranford\u2019s team is rounded-out with highly skilled and professional investors and operators, who understand that carefully listening to the needs of entrepreneurs and management teams is crucial to recognizing the distinct needs of a business and helping it to achieve enduring success.\nBranford\u2019s investing experience makes it a world-class partner both in closing a transaction and in helping to build businesses:\n\nTRANSACTION EXPERIENCE\nOur principals have closed hundreds of private market transactions, some as large as $1 billion in transaction value.\n\nTRANSACTION STRUCTURING\nBranford typically requires a control stake in a business post-transaction, but encourages management teams and prior owners to re-invest equity in the company and can structure highly tailored and flexible transactions to meet the needs of all involved in the deal.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO THE BUSINESS\nBranford spends a significant amount of time post-transaction working with portfolio company executives to augment the existing operations and to grow the business to new heights.\n\nOPERATING EXPERIENCE\nGiven the hundreds of companies our principals have worked with, we have accumulated an exceptional amount of knowledge in terms of helping companies grow. We recognize that the first thing to do is to listen to the experience and the histories of the executives and owners who have first-hand experience running the business.\n\nBRANFORD PHILOSOPHY\n\nBranford believes that a good partnership is good business. That core belief underlies everything we do at Branford, from our collaborative style to the close relationships we build with our portfolio company management teams.
