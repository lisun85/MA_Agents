This is the embodiment of what PennSpring Capital brings to business owners and industry executives alike. We believe that care and commitment are as central to success as are discipline and diligence, and our track record supports this unique people-forward approach to private equity.\n\nThe Resources to Close. The Support to Scale.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania-based PennSpring is specifically engineered to assist companies that are not quite ready for institutional capital. Specifically, we specialize in elevating companies with EBITDA of $750,000 - $5 million to the next tier of $5 million and beyond - and thus positioned for an institutional audience. With a robust rolodex of ways to finance transactions, including direct investment, we can close quickly.\n\n\nThrough this process we give company owners their desired measure of liquidity and, perhaps more importantly, \"a second bite at a larger apple\". With the potential exception of retirement scenarios, we strongly prefer that the entrepreneur \"rollover\" a meaningful stake (20 - 45% of the company). PennSpring principals invest and provide critical advisory services and strategic connections, but we do not meddle in the day-to-day operations of the company\u2026we align with expert management for a reason.\u00a0\n\nInvestment Criteria\n$10 - $50 MM\n$750K - $5 MM\n$3\u00a0- $30 MM\n>50%\nGeography\nRevenue\nEBITDA\nTransaction Size\nRequired Ownership\nKey14\u2122\n\nThe 14 counties of the Keystone State\u2019s South Central region are renowned for their business ingenuity, innovation and diligence \u2013 as well as an unrivaled commitment to community. We strive to both echo and reward this set of ideals at PennSpring. With roots tracing to Lancaster\u2019s founding, we are proud to have earned our place as the PE/M&A solution for business owners in the Key14\u2122.\n\nPennSpring is also open to exploring opportunities in other geographies that share a similar ethos and meet our investment criteria.\nCommon Company Characteristics\nPennSpring targets companies with the following characteristics:\n\n\u200b\n\nCommitted and passionate management team willing to work in partnership with PennSpring\n\nCompelling value proposition with defensible market, customer and product positions\n\nSolid long-term industry fundamentals (non-cyclical, non-commodity businesses)\n\nHistory of consistent, predictable and stable revenue and earnings\n\nIdentifiable organic and acquired growth opportunities\n\nPennSpring Advantages\nEXPERIENCED\nINVESTORS\nPEOPLE-FORWARD\nAPPROACH\nGROWTH\u00a0\nFOCUS\nPARTNERSHIP WITH MANAGEMENT\nCERTAINTY & SPEED TO CLOSE\nKEYSTONE CEO\nPROGRAM\nTestimonials\n\n\u201cPennSpring was an incredible steward of our organization.

Lou was instrumental in professionalizing our business and providing a superior return for all, via our successful exit to Blue Star Sports - a portfolio company of GenStar Capital.\"\n\n- Jason Frazier, CEO Skyhawks Sports\n\n\"The experience of working with Lou and group revolutionized BEAME Lighting.
