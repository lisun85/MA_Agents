Ayesa Engineering Acquires CORE

28 January 2025 – The Engineering division of Ayesa, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments under management, has acquired CORE, a project management firm specialising in large-scale data centres and real estate developments.

Founded in 2014, CORE provides project management services across various sectors, including data centres, residential, hotels, and hospitals, focussing on major iconic projects. We believe CORE’s competitive advantage lies in the implementation of Lean Construction methodologies, which significantly reduce costs and optimise execution times.

We believe this acquisition represents a further milestone in Ayesa Engineering’s strategy to grow in high-value segments and enhance its service and end-market diversification.

CORE represents Ayesa’s tenth transaction since AMCE’s investment in January 2022.
