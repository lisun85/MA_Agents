Through this strategic partnership, AMCP III will be acquiring a majority stake in ECP and is expected to work closely with the Company\u2019s founder, Darren Donohue, to grow the business, diversify its service platform, and expand its service territories across the country. The deal is expected to close in the next 30 days, subject to certain approvals.\n\nHeadquartered in Albany, NY, ECP provides safe and reliable repair and maintenance services to electrical utility customers supporting transmission and distribution power line infrastructure throughout the East Coast. The Company\u2019s comprehensive service platform includes maintenance, repair, upgrade, restoration, and emergency response solutions for electric power distribution, transmission, and substation systems. ECP was founded by Mr. Donohue, a senior executive who has nearly 35 years of sector experience. Mr. Donohue is an active member of, and maintains strong relations with, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\u201cIBEW\u201d) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (\u201cNECA\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to partner with AMCP III on this exciting next chapter at ECP,\u201d said Mr. Donohue. \u201cBetween the ever-growing demands on our power grids, aging infrastructure throughout most of the country, and increasing storms and extreme weather events, the need for safe, effective, at-the-ready electric utility services has never been greater. I founded ECP to address mission critical needs of the power grid, and I believe we have built a stellar reputation as a go-to provider to the major utilities on the East Coast, trusted for our relentless commitment to safety, quality, and operational excellence. Now, as we invite AMCP III in as our partners, we believe we have powerful access to capital and other key resources to build on this success and support our expansion nationally.\u201d\n\nECP\u2019s expansion plans are focused on select markets throughout the United States and Canada. The Company, whose leadership team has a strong track record of successful acquisitions and integrations, will collaborate with AMCP III to leverage both organic growth initiatives and strategic M&A to execute this expansion.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of AMCP III, we are excited to take this next step in bringing Darren and his team into our portfolio,\u201d said Ryan McCarthy, a Partner with AMCP. \u201cECP is a founder-led platform that has a strong infrastructure, strong culture, and a clear direction forward, and Darren, who will remain a large shareholder and operating executive, is a true industry expert and proven operator who understands the evolving priorities of the sector\u2019s customers and stakeholders. Moreover, the Company is addressing the mission critical issue of North America\u2019s power grids, which require significant infrastructure investments and reliable services from companies like ECP to effectively address ever increasing power demands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe ECP is well-positioned to be an acquisition platform in a fast-growing and highly fragmented industry,\u201d added Jack McCarthy, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of A&M Capital. \u201cWe are very much aligned with ECP\u2019s growth strategy and share Darren\u2019s vision for the future, which includes identifying complementary acquisition targets that fit with ECP\u2019s safety and reliability-driven culture, expanding the Company\u2019s geographic footprint, and diversifying its customer base.\u201d\n\nFor more information about ECP, including employment opportunities or inquiries regarding selling an electric utility services business to the Company, please visit www.eastcoastpowerllc.com.\n\nFor more information about A&M Capital and AMCP, please visit www.a-mcapital.com.\n\nHarris Williams served as exclusive financial advisor to A&M Capital Partners.\n\nAbout East Coast Power\n\nFounded in 2023, East Coast Power is a leading provider of safe and reliable electric utility services.
