Ayesa Engineering Acquires ADP Consulting

27 February 2025 – The Engineering division of Ayesa, a portfolio company of A&M Capital Europe (“AMCE”), a London-based private equity firm with €650 million of commitments, has acquired ADP Consulting, a leading Australian engineering consultancy headquartered in Melbourne.
