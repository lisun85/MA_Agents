TARGET SITUATIONS

We seek to invest in high-quality market leaders in fundamentally attractive categories, where our sector knowledge and pan-European investment expertise will enable the business to accelerate its growth trajectory. Specifically, we look for control or significant minority stakes in the following:

 

Businesses backed by founders or families that are looking to de-risk and or gain access to institutional capital and know-how to accelerate growth and achieve their full potential

Private equity owned and “Platform” acquisitions that will enable us to pursue buy-and-build and pan-European consolidation strategies, as well as global expansion

Corporate divestitures, benefiting from our extensive experience of efficiently carving out businesses and driving their independent success

Public to private transactions, in selective and appropriate circumstances
