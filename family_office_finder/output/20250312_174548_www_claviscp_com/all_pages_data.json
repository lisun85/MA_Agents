We\u2019re just as comfortable with blue jeans, hard hats and a little elbow grease as we are in the c-suite or a sea of spreadsheets.\n\nCurious\n\nOur consultancy roots are a key driver in the way we solve problems. We\u2019re curious about the world around us and are in it to find the right answer, not the first or easiest one. We evaluate without ego and don\u2019t shy away from deep dives or diverse voices.\n\nResilient\n\nOur growth mindset is grounded in a lifetime of real-world experience. We work through problems, have the grit to overcome significant challenges and keep our eye on the larger picture.\n\nAuthentic\n\nNo egos or hidden agendas, we bring our whole selves to our work. We know who we are and who we are not and conduct ourselves in an open and honest manner.\n\nGUITAR WALL\n\nWe are music lovers at heart and our crew has rock-and-roll roots. For each of our portfolio companies, we make two unique, custom-made guitars \u2013 one we send to the company headquarters and one that hangs on our \u201cguitar wall\u201d located prominently in our Dallas offices for all the world to see.\n\nEach guitar incorporates the unique personality and culture of the company it represents. It\u2019s truly one of our team\u2019s favorite moments to hang a new guitar for a recently completed investment in one of our portfolio companies.\n\nCOLLABORATION\n\nOur firm\u2019s ethos is based on open and frequent communication and collaboration \u2013 with each other, our portfolio companies, our partners, and our investors.\n\nWe believe deeply that success is ultimately determined not by individuals but by a team of dedicated people working together toward common goals.\n\nCLAVIS \u201cGAME ROOM\u201d\n\nWhile we work very hard at what we do, we like to play hard as well. Of course we have the obligatory ping pong table (the scene of many late night spirited matches) but doesn\u2019t every office have an F1 Racing Simulator?\n\nCLAVIS CULTURE CONFERENCES\n\nEach year, we host an event that brings together our full eco-system of partners \u2013 portfolio company leaders, investors, Clavis personnel and other partners and friends \u2013 to collaborate, learn from each other and celebrate our collective partnership.

      "content": "WHAT WE BELIEVE\nOur guiding principles.\nGrowth Orientation\n\nOur focus is on growth opportunities, not cost-cutting programs. Growth is exciting and inspiring. Cost-cutting hurts morale and affects people\u2019s lives. As a result, we are most interested in platform opportunities with good organic growth and add-on pathways.\n\nPatience\n\nOur focus is on the long term, not next quarter or next year. Often, we expect the profitability of our portfolio companies will decline in the first few periods as we invest in new resources to achieve longer term growth.\n\nPerspective\n\nWe\u2019ve been around the block a few times and have seen our share of successes and failures. Collectively, our team has participated in 50+ transactions representing over $1 billion of capital deployed. Some worked. Others didn\u2019t. As a result, we have a pretty good perspective on what works, what doesn\u2019t and how long it takes to get to the finish line.\n\nResponsible Leverage\n\nDebt is cheap capital. It\u2019s also dangerous when overused. We limit the amount of debt capital that we use in our transactions to ensure that we don't put our portfolio companies at risk. We don't use debt for dividend recaps.\n\nStrong Sense of Self\n\nWe know who we are and, more importantly, who we are not. We are comfortable in our skin and are not convinced that we are the smartest people in the room. We value different perspectives and experiences and the people who share them.\n\nWin-Win Culture\n\nWe purposely look for win-win opportunities where our investment can benefit not only our investors and the seller, but the remaining employees, customers and the community.\n\nCLAVIS IMPACT FUND\nEvery impact counts.\n\nOur people-first purpose doesn\u2019t stop at investments. We take action to support our surrounding community, and allocate a portion of returns to charity.\n\nLEARN MORE\nLET\u2019S TALK\n8235 Douglas\nSuite 960\nDallas, Texas 75225\n214.812.9199\ninfo@claviscp.com\nINVESTMENT CRITERIA\nINVESTOR LOGIN\nCLAVIS IMPACT FUND\nLINKEDIN\nCLAVIS STORE\nCLAVIS PRESS\n\n\u00a9 2025 \u2014 Clavis Capital Partners.
