We work our way from the c-suite to the factory floor, building custom-fit solutions that leave a lasting impact.\n\nOUR TEAM\nBusiness builders at\u00a0heart.\nTodd Dauphinais\n\nFounding Principal & Managing Partner\n\nMEET THE CHIEF CULTURE OFFICER\nPatrick Hamner\n\nManaging Director\n\nMEET THE BULLDOG\nJimmy Watson\n\nManaging Director\n\nMEET THE CONDUCTOR\nAfshar Sanati\n\nVice President\n\nMEET THE RATIONALIST\nCULTURE\nOurs and yours are extremely important to\u00a0us.\nScrappy\n\nResourceful, hands on and self reliant. We\u2019re just as comfortable with blue jeans, hard hats and a little elbow grease as we are in the c-suite or a sea of spreadsheets.\n\nCurious\n\nOur consultancy roots are a key driver in the way we solve problems. We\u2019re curious about the world around us and are in it to find the right answer, not the first or easiest one. We evaluate without ego and don\u2019t shy away from deep dives or diverse voices.\n\nResilient\n\nOur growth mindset is grounded in a lifetime of real-world experience. We work through problems, have the grit to overcome significant challenges and keep our eye on the larger picture.\n\nAuthentic\n\nNo egos or hidden agendas, we bring our whole selves to our work. We know who we are and who we are not and conduct ourselves in an open and honest manner.\n\nGUITAR WALL\n\nWe are music lovers at heart and our crew has rock-and-roll roots. For each of our portfolio companies, we make two unique, custom-made guitars \u2013 one we send to the company headquarters and one that hangs on our \u201cguitar wall\u201d located prominently in our Dallas offices for all the world to see.\n\nEach guitar incorporates the unique personality and culture of the company it represents. It\u2019s truly one of our team\u2019s favorite moments to hang a new guitar for a recently completed investment in one of our portfolio companies.\n\nCOLLABORATION\n\nOur firm\u2019s ethos is based on open and frequent communication and collaboration \u2013 with each other, our portfolio companies, our partners, and our investors.\n\nWe believe deeply that success is ultimately determined not by individuals but by a team of dedicated people working together toward common goals.\n\nCLAVIS \u201cGAME ROOM\u201d\n\nWhile we work very hard at what we do, we like to play hard as well. Of course we have the obligatory ping pong table (the scene of many late night spirited matches) but doesn\u2019t every office have an F1 Racing Simulator?\n\nCLAVIS CULTURE CONFERENCES\n\nEach year, we host an event that brings together our full eco-system of partners \u2013 portfolio company leaders, investors, Clavis personnel and other partners and friends \u2013 to collaborate, learn from each other and celebrate our collective partnership. Dubbed the Clavis Culture Conference, this has become a highly anticipated event on our collective calendars.\n\n\u00a0\nTodd Dauphinais\n\nFounding Principal & Managing Partner\n\ntdauphinais@claviscp.com\n214.989.7050\nLet\u2019s Connect\n\nTodd chairs the Clavis Investment Committee and runs point on all of the firm\u2019s investment, operational and fundraising activities and is actively involved in the strategy and governance of all of Clavis\u2019 portfolio companies.\n\nTodd lends a unique blend of successful strategic, operational, investment and acquisition experience to his efforts at Clavis.
