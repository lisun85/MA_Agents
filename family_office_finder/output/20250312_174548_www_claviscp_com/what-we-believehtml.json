    "content": "WHAT WE BELIEVE\nOur guiding principles.\nGrowth Orientation\n\nOur focus is on growth opportunities, not cost-cutting programs. Growth is exciting and inspiring. Cost-cutting hurts morale and affects people\u2019s lives. As a result, we are most interested in platform opportunities with good organic growth and add-on pathways.\n\nPatience\n\nOur focus is on the long term, not next quarter or next year. Often, we expect the profitability of our portfolio companies will decline in the first few periods as we invest in new resources to achieve longer term growth.\n\nPerspective\n\nWe\u2019ve been around the block a few times and have seen our share of successes and failures. Collectively, our team has participated in 50+ transactions representing over $1 billion of capital deployed. Some worked. Others didn\u2019t. As a result, we have a pretty good perspective on what works, what doesn\u2019t and how long it takes to get to the finish line.\n\nResponsible Leverage\n\nDebt is cheap capital. It\u2019s also dangerous when overused. We limit the amount of debt capital that we use in our transactions to ensure that we don't put our portfolio companies at risk. We don't use debt for dividend recaps.\n\nStrong Sense of Self\n\nWe know who we are and, more importantly, who we are not. We are comfortable in our skin and are not convinced that we are the smartest people in the room. We value different perspectives and experiences and the people who share them.\n\nWin-Win Culture\n\nWe purposely look for win-win opportunities where our investment can benefit not only our investors and the seller, but the remaining employees, customers and the community.\n\nCLAVIS IMPACT FUND\nEvery impact counts.\n\nOur people-first purpose doesn\u2019t stop at investments. We take action to support our surrounding community, and allocate a portion of returns to charity.\n\nLEARN MORE\nLET\u2019S TALK\n8235 Douglas\nSuite 960\nDallas, Texas 75225\n214.812.9199\ninfo@claviscp.com\nINVESTMENT CRITERIA\nINVESTOR LOGIN\nCLAVIS IMPACT FUND\nLINKEDIN\nCLAVIS STORE\nCLAVIS PRESS\n\n\u00a9 2025 \u2014 Clavis Capital Partners.
