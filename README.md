🚀 M&A Agents - AI-Powered Sell-Side M&A Outreach
📌 Overview
The M&A Agents system automates the sell-side M&A outreach process using a multi-agent AI architecture. This platform reduces manual inefficiencies in identifying, analyzing, and engaging potential buyers by leveraging CrewAI, Exa.ai, Firecrawl, and Qdrant.

✨ Key Features
✅ Automated Buyer Discovery – Expands beyond seed lists using AI-powered web scraping.
✅ Deep Buyer Profiling – Extracts structured investment data from buyer websites.
✅ News & Market Context Analysis – Fetches relevant acquisition and funding news.
✅ Intelligent Buyer Matching – AI-driven decision-making for suitability analysis.
✅ Hyper-Personalized Outreach – Generates tailored emails to engage potential buyers.
✅ Buyer Interaction Management – Handles responses, scheduling, and follow-ups.

🏗️ System Architecture
The system is powered by six AI agents, each handling a specialized task:

1️⃣ Discovery Agent – Uses Exa.ai to find new buyers based on industry & AUM criteria.
2️⃣ Profile Scraper Agent – Uses Firecrawl & CrewAI Scraper to collect firmographic & investment details.
3️⃣ News Scraper Agent – Leverages Google News API & Serper to extract relevant buyer news.
4️⃣ Analysis/Matching Agent – Uses AI reasoning to determine buyer fit based on historical transactions.
5️⃣ Engagement Agent – Generates and sends highly personalized email outreach.
6️⃣ Response Agent – Manages responses and assists in scheduling meetings.
