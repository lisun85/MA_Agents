# INVESTMENT STRATEGY, APPROACH & CRITERIA

## Investment Approach & Philosophy

Hadley acquired 4AllPromos in partnership with a promotional products industry executive.

When the time comes you’ll want a partner with unmatched experience.

More than just capital, a strategic partner for what lies ahead.

We partnered with the company’s chief chemist to purchase Cambridge Major from the widow of the company’s founder.

She had been running the business for a few years following her husband’s death and wanted to retire.

Hadley partnered with Centare’s management team to buy the company from a husband-and-wife team that wanted to sell the business to fund their retirement and also leave their business and its employees in good hands.

After nearly nine years of successful ownership, in 2021 Hadley sold Centare to Rural Sourcing Inc., a large strategic acquirer owned by Bain Capital. Rural Sourcing was attracted to Centare’s premium customer base and talented team of highly capable developers.

Hadley partnered with the company’s existing management and an industry executive to purchase the business from Kelatron’s two owner/operators who were ready to retire. Hadley helped to transition management oversight of the business to the new team while simultaneously providing the owners with liquidity for retirement.

Hadley owned Kelatron for twelve years during which its revenue and profitability grew well. We then sold it in 2011 to Innophos, a large company that produces specialty phosphate and nutritional products.

Hadley bought SGA and worked with the existing management team to implement a growth strategy.

SGA grew substantially under Hadley’s nine years of ownership by adding new services, entering new geographic markets and completing a major acquisition, and then we sold SGA to a larger private equity firm in 2015.

Hadley acquired the business in partnership with a 2nd generation family member and promoted her to President.

Over time, Storflex leadership and Hadley pursued a patient improvement plan that was designed to increase the company’s capabilities and capacities.

Are You Working With A Company That Fits Our Approach?

Small Business Private Equity

For Long-Term Growth

We Buy Small Companies

A dedicated partner that understands your unique situation and that getting it right matters.

We’ve done it for over 20 years

We’ve committed millions of dollars to back it up. We get it because we’ve done it, it’s all we do.

We have acquired more than 25 companies that represent an exclusive group of market leaders.

Hadley Capital, a private equity firm specializing in small company acquisitions, has been a leader  in its space for over two decades.

Small Business Private Equity

Management Buyout

a private equity firm specializing in small company acquisitions

Hadley is not a professional valuation firm. We are small company owners and investors with more than two decades of experience buying dozens of small companies.

Hadley values companies based on their ability to generate future operating cash flows....

Hadley Capital is a principal investor, not an intermediary. We buy companies using our own capital.

Hadley Capital is an equity investor, not a lender.

Hadley Capital is a control investor.

This does not mean that we want to control the day-to-day operations of the company. Instead, we expect the management team (many of whom are also shareholders) to run each business. Hadley Capital’s role is to provide strategic direction, manage the lending relationships, investigate add-on acquisition opportunities, etc.

Hadley Capital has occasionally been a minority investor but in these instances we have still held a certain level of legal control.

Hadley Capital is a long-term investor. We do not ‘flip’ investments or seek to generate returns through short-term financial wizardry. Hadley Capital has not sold a business in less than seven years from the time we acquired it.

Hadley Capital will be there to partner with the management team to determine any changes that need to be made to the business.

At times we are the outsourced CFO, the business development team, or a strategic consultant. At all times we are interested and active board members. We believe that our collective experience allows us to offer sound and prudent advice and guidance that, over time, adds value to each company.

At the heart of Hadley’s value creation model is the Hadley Ownership System, a proprietary
framework for developing and growing companies. This system focuses on aligning leadership,
streamlining operations, and driving sustainable growth.

Hadley Capital, a private equity firm specializing in small company acquisitions, has been a leader  in its space for over two decades.

Hadley Capital has helped multiple family businesses - from 2nd generation up to 6th generation - achieve a successful management succession and concurrent ownership transition.

Hadley Capital has partnered with more than a dozen owner-managers to address the competing goals of most owner-managers: transitioning day-to-day management and securing retirement funds through the sale or recapitalization of the business.

We are experts at management succession and ownership transition in small companies, read about one such success story with JRI Industries.

Over the years, Hadley Capital has helped a number of management teams acquire the businesses they are running from inactive owners.

Experienced small company investors like Hadley Capital are well-positioned to achieve both management succession and ownership transitions through a sale or partial sale/recapitalization.

Hadley Capital can provide management transition support and, at the same time, has the capital necessary to fully fund, in cash, the ownership transition.

Hadley Capital also has a substantial amount of flexibility to address the unique situations and circumstances facing business owners, families, and management teams.

Hadley Capital has decades of experience in addressing management succession and ownership transition with small business owners and managers.

Though Hadley is generally industry agnostic, ETA searchers may find that developing an industry focus (and expertise) is helpful in two important domains: 

quickly evaluating potential acquisition candidates  
differentiating themselves in a competitive acquisition process.

Hadley works with experienced industry executives in a hybrid version of the sponsored search model. In this case, Hadley provides our industry executive partners with access to our proprietary buyside relationships that can help quickly identify target companies for sale and facilitate introductions to owners.

Our industry executive partners provide the industry knowledge and expertise that separates us (as a team) from other potential buyers.

Once a target is identified, Hadley then provides resources to evaluate the target, conduct due diligence, and complete the acquisition.

In addition, Hadley provides the bulk of the equity financing to complete the acquisition. 

Hadley has been in the small company acquisition market for nearly 20 years and our deal flow pipeline is robust. 

As a result, we review thousands of acquisition opportunities every year yet we aim to acquire 1 - 2 companies per year.

Hadley Capital, a private equity firm specializing in small company acquisitions, has been a leader  in its space for over two decades.

nearly all Hadley Capital acquisitions include a small portion of seller financing.

Hadley partners with small companies like Centare that are in need of ownership transition, management succession, and growth support.

Hadley also helps small company owners in need of management succession and/or support to pursue growth strategies.

When Hadley Capital acquires a company we do not look to make immediate changes to the business.

We typically buy businesses from owner/managers who want to retire, either immediately or over the next few years.

If the owner is the most valuable person in the businesses, which is often the case, our transition risk is higher. This has a negative impact on value. If, on the other hand, the owner/manager is not the most important person, and there are lots of other important people working in the business, then our transition risk is lower. This has a positive impact on value.

Just because an owner/manager who wants to retire is important to a business doesn't mean that Hadley Capital can't buy it, only that we need to first think through how we might most successfully transition it to another manager or team of managers.

Hadley has worked with a number of management teams and owners on successful management buyouts.

When we find an attractive acquisition candidate we can invest in that company without outside approval.

Hadley Capital is a private equity firm.  We are currently investing Hadley Capital Fund III, LP a limited partnership formed to purchase control investments in small, private companies.

We also use debt, both senior bank debt and sometimes mezzanine debt, to affect our transactions, thus the term ‘leveraged buyout.’

Buyouts most often include a change in majority control of the company. Thus, using the cash flows of their acquisition targets to make the interest and principal payments on the debt.

Hadley Capital sometimes finds companies that need to do a leveraged buyout to provide liquidity for a retiring owner-operator, but which also need growth equity to grow in a targeted way.

In these cases, we often think of the investment in two parts.

In the first part, we provide the capital (equity and debt) to complete the buyout while also planning for the second part. That is, providing enough capital for completing the buyout while ensuring a robust balance sheet remains to support the growth strategy.

Hadley Capital is primarily a private equity firm that sometimes makes growth equity investments. We do not make venture capital investments or invest in distressed situations, but we find it’s valuable to distinguish between the three so that business owners coming to us with questions know where to find the answers.

Hadley uses two forms of traditional, commercial debt when acquiring a small business: a senior term loan and a revolving line of credit.

Hadley is able to operate without personal guarantees.

At Hadley, our choice of financing sources is designed to provide the business with enough flexibility to grow while optimizing its cost of capital. A typical Hadley transaction will utilize a senior term loan, a revolving line of credit, and equity.

So instead of coming in with grand plans for change, we seek to ‘first, do no harm' by taking 6 – 12 months getting to know the people running the company, learning more about the business, etc.

Then, after building mutual trust and confidence, we begin implementing 1 – 3 strategic initiatives per year. We tend to focus initially on the lowest hanging fruit in order to achieve small wins that require relatively little capital and involve low risk of failure.

Our ‘first, do no harm' approach is also well aligned with our long term strategy. Since we're not looking to flip companies a couple years after acquisition we can take the time to make incremental improvements.

We can create a lot of value in a business by consistently hitting singles over a long period of time…it's kind of like the power of compounding.

My partners and I think and act like owners because we are owners. As a group, the three of us are the second largest investor in our investment funds.  Our significant personal commitments make a big difference to owners that are considering selling their small business and to the managers of companies owned by Hadley Capital.

Since my partners and I put up significant personal money to buy a company, we aren’t going to take crazy risks after we buy a company.  In fact, our motto is ‘first, do no harm.’

My partners and I were able to address these concerns by pointing to our successful track record of working with small companies, our ‘first, do no harm’ approach, and our significant personal commitments involved in acquiring SGA.

Like most owners we don’t spend frivolously, we don’t fly first class or stay in fancy hotels.  But we do take a long-term view when evaluating critical business decisions.

However, purchasing the machine was clearly in the best interest of the company (and our customers) over the long-term.

Many private equity buyers claim that they are long-term investors who think and act like owners but very few back it up with significant financial commitments.

Practitioners like Hadley often add non-recurring items back to EBITDA.

In order to fully evaluate a firm’s cash flow, which is very important to investors like Hadley who seek to use leverage to affect their transactions (thus the term ‘leveraged buyouts’), we utilize much more complete financial models.

Hadley Capital values Companies based on their ability generate sustainable, operating cash flows. We typically apply a multiple to the annual, sustainable operating cash flow of a business to estimate its value. We use EBITDA as a rough but good estimation of operating cash flow. To determine sustainable cash flow, we adjust EBITDA to include some positive and negative add backs.

At Hadley Capital, we are private equity investors with capital on hand, which means that most of our transactions involve substantial cash at closing. We can structure payment using a variety of financing techniques but most sellers prefer cash even if our valuation appears slightly lower than a competing offer with complicated or protracted buyout contingencies.

Hadley Capital’s valuations are almost always based on an enterprise value, rather than an equity value, and are usually on a cash-free, debt-free basis.

Hadley Capital acquisitions always include a working capital adjustment at closing.

Originator of Small Company Private Equity Hits Hard Cap for Fund IV

For nearly 20 years, we have focused exclusively on…

We have been very successful at helping families address generational transitions, founders complete recapitalizations and management teams buy out inactive owners or founders.

Hadley Capital has a wealth of experience working with family-owned businesses on recapitalizations and generational transfers.

Under the Hadley Ownership SystemTM, GT Golf completed a seamless leadership transition, allowing Craig to step away from the business and spend more time on his non-profit endeavors. Following the leadership transition, Hadley and GT Golf’s new management team invested in critical foundations to support future growth, including advanced information technology systems, new warehouse locations, expanding the team, and e-commerce capabilities.

The Hadley Ownership System was developed specifically to assist small companies achieve success in one of the most challenging periods in a small company’s lifecycle – a transition from a founder/owner to a new phase of leadership and ownership.

Hadley Capital has more than $40 million of committed equity capital.

Hadley Capital focuses on transactions requiring $2–$10 million in equity, an investment range
perfectly aligned to the lower middle market “sweet spot”.

Hadley’s Independent Sponsor Alliance is designed for transactions that meet the following criteria:

Market Purchase Price: Fair and reasonable valuations
Growth Potential: Clear opportunities for expansion and operational improvement
Target Industries: Light manufacturing, business services, and specialty distribution
Alignment: Shared values and strategic goals between the sponsor and Hadley

If you are a business broker and you have a business that meets our criteria, please contact us.

We typically use 1x–1.5x EBITDA (or cash flow) of mezzanine debt in an acquisition.

Our experience shows that 3x total debt (2x EBITDA of senior debt + 1x EBITDA of mezzanine debt) is typically an appropriate amount of debt in a small company acquisition.

For example, Hadley has completed buyouts of businesses with only $5 million of revenue.

Compared to larger M&A transactions, we typically borrow senior debt that represents about twice a company's annual EBITDA (commonly described as 2.0x Debt/EBITDA). That is, if the target company has $1 million in annual EBITDA, we borrow $2 million in senior term debt. In finance lingo, this is called "2x senior leverage".

Hadley Capital focuses on buying solid small businesses with bright futures.

Of the 1,000 or so businesses we evaluate each year, we negotiate to acquire less than 5%, so I think it is fair to say that these are some of the best small businesses in America.

typically, investors such as Hadley Capital want to see EBITDA margins in excess of 10%

typically, investors such as Hadley want to see EBITDA margins in excess of 10%

Once sustainable EBITDA is determined, Hadley Capital applies a multiple of EBITDA to determine the Enterprise Value of your business. In general, smaller companies typically trade for between 3x to 5x normalized EBITDA.

For nearly 20 years, we have focused exclusively on buying small, profitable companies.

Family business succession generally involves passing management of the business from one generation to the next generation. According to a report from the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago, three-quarters of family-owned manufacturing companies had baby boomer owners and, and of those, half had no plans for succession. Overall, 62 percent of family-owned manufacturing companies had not designated a specific successor.

Geographic focus may also be a significant consideration, particularly for someone later in their career or with important family considerations (kids in high school, for example).

While a geographic preference can help focus the search, it can also introduce an extremely limiting element to the search.

Generally, the tighter the geographic circle, the smaller number of potential acquisition candidates.

Earlier this week I talked to an ETA searcher trying to identify and acquire a small manufacturing business in Michigan and heard a common refrain: “I need more deal flow.”  

After reviewing all of his shipment history, Bob was surprised to learn that 60% of his customers live in Texas, 30% in Florida, and the balance elsewhere.

Bob decided to allocate more marketing and customer acquisition resources to Texas since so many of his customers are located there.

The company regarded the acquisition as an opportunity to add two Middle America Locations to Rural Sourcing's onshore delivery center network.

Through the onshore framework that brings technology jobs to Middle America, Rural Sourcing is developing a new tech hub, expanding opportunities for skilled workers and delivering world-class development work for their customers. The acquisition of Centare facilitates the expansion of Rural Sourcing to the Midwest and has a strong cohesion in terms of culture, colleagues, and society.

Bluff Manufacturing manufactures and sells heavy-duty steel and aluminum dock boards and plates, portable yard ramps, and other warehouse safety equipment to companies throughout North America.

# TEAM AND CONTACTS

4AllPromos was founded in 2005 and is based in Essex, CT.

Hadley acquired 4AllPromos in partnership with a promotional products industry executive.

As an owner-managed company, the two aging partners – both of whom were actively involved on a day-to-day basis - needed a transition solution that provided both a road map toward retirement and liquidity to secure their financial future.

Clark Smith grew Bluff Manufacturing from a small metal fabrication shop into a leading, branded manufacturer of heavy-duty material handling equipment.

Hadley met Clark in 2011 when he was looking for a partner to help him acquire the business from an inactive ownership group.

Clark was eager to gain an experienced partner to help him transition leadership of the business and to support his team’s growth strategy.

Andrea moved quickly, implementing numerous growth and improvement plans with Hadley’s support. Bluff added financial systems and staff, invested heavily in new marketin...

- Andrea Curreri, President of Bluff Manufacturing

- Tim Eiring, CEO of Centare

Hadley partnered with Custom Label’s existing managers and other industry executives to purchase Custom Label from its founder, who wanted to retire.

Custom Label has invested significant capital to increase and modernize its production equipment, add sales and marketing personnel and complete add-on acquisitions.

Filter is based in Union, NJ, near New York City.

Hadley acquired the two predecessor entities to Filter Holdings from their founder who had successfully built the businesses over many years. Hadley has successfully transitioned the business to a new management team including key members of the previous team.

- Charlie Gillinder, 6th generation family owner

Craig Pollard built GT Golf Supplies from a one-man traveling sales effort into the nation’s leading distributor of golf accessories.

Craig was still instrumental to GT Golf and was leading the business day-to-day.

Following a successful Transition, Craig was free to pursue his other passion while Brian and the rest of the management team, along with our support, got to work laying the Foundation required...

- Craig Pollard, Founder of GT Golf Supplies

Started by Dad, employing several family members (son, daughter in-law, nephew, etc.)

- Michael Feldman, President of i-deal Optics

Jack Rogers, the founder and president of JRI Industries, wanted to sell a portion of his business but he was not quite ready to retire.

Jack was synonymous with JRI—JRI stood for Jack Rogers Inc.—and he ran a good company, but he wanted help to take it to the next level.

Transitioning from Jack’s leadership took several years but success came when Jim Jones joined JRI as President. Eventually, Jack felt comfortable leaving the company in Jim’s hands.

- Jim Jones, Former CEO of JRI

Hadley partnered with Jeff Potts, the brother of New Age’s founder, to acquire the business.

The two brothers had been managing the business together for several years. The founding brother was ready to retire while Jeff wanted to continue to grow and develop the company.

Hadley worked with Jeff Potts to substantially improve the administrative aspects of the business after closing, primarily by hiring new personnel and adding financial and other systems to help Jeff and his staff manage the business.

Jeff Potts is a very hands-on leader.

- Jeff Potts, President of New Age Cryo

PSI is based in Phoenix, Arizona.

- Matthew Hemenez, CEO of Pneu-Con

Hadley acquired QDx Pathology from and with the company’s Founder / C.E.O. / Chief Medical Director, Dr. Qureshi.

Since Dr. Qureshi was staying on as CEO, we did not have to engage in very much transition planning or implementation.

Dr. Qureshi asked Hadley to help him develop and implement a plan for meaningful growth.

The foundational changes we helped Dr. Qureshi and his key managers to make to QDx have paid off well.

- Dr. M. Nasar Qureshi, Founder and CEO of QDx Pathology

- Sharon Grosso, President of Storflex and second generation owner

We called on our friend Professor Mark Smith, Ph. D, lecturer at the University of Illinois, to help us develop an outline for this blog post.

Based on the most recent data from Mark Smith’s ETA course, it is estimated all other search models account for less than 100 acquisitions per year.

Tom Matlock, an Investor and CEO writes more about what he looks for in a search funder in his article “Defining Industry Boundaries for a Search Fund”. Below is a small preview of what he says:

“What I’m really listening for is how the search funder thinks about the industry.

What sectors do they find attractive and why?

How are those sectors related in any way to their past experience, their network, the things that they have already done?

How do they think about generating deal flow in these sectors?

What are they actually planning on doing, when they hit the ground, to start the process that they hope will end with them buying a company and becoming CEO?”

If you’re actively pursuing entrepreneurship through acquisition and are looking for an experienced partner, feel free to email us at info@hadleycapital.com.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/faq TITLE: Small Business Private Equity FAQ | Hadley Capital BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Frequently Asked Questions About Small Business Private Equity Is Hadley Capital the buyer or another intermediary? Hadley Capital is a principal investor, not an intermediary. We buy companies using our own capital. Does Hadley Capital really have money to invest? Yes. Hadley Capital has more than $40 million of committed equity capital. We can fund transactions on short notice if required but we usually make our investment decisions in an orderly fashion. Is Hadley Capital a lender? No. Hadley Capital is an equity investor, not a lender. However, we often use debt to finance acquisitions. In such cases, Hadley Capital will arrange for debt financing that is non-recourse to all owners (no one will personally guarantee the debt). One of Hadley Capital’s areas of expertise is determining and arranging appropriate capital structures. Who are the decision makers at Hadley Capital? Hadley Capital’s three partners make all of the investment decisions for the partnership. We write the checks. When speaking to one of Hadley Capital’s partners you are speaking directly to a decision maker. Does Hadley Capital make minority investments? Hadley Capital is a control investor. This does not mean that we want to control the day-to-day operations of the company. Instead, we expect the management team (many of whom are also shareholders) to run each business. Hadley Capital’s role is to provide strategic direction, manage the lending relationships, investigate add-on acquisition opportunities, etc. Hadley Capital has occasionally been a minority investor but in these instances we have still held a certain level of legal control. How long does Hadley Capital hold its investments? Hadley Capital is a long-term investor. We do not ‘flip’ investments or seek to generate returns through short-term financial wizardry. Hadley Capital has not sold a business in less than seven years from the time we acquired it. How long will it take to sell my company? In general, Hadley Capital closes and funds transactions about 90 days after we enter into a letter of intent. Learn more about the process of selling your company to Hadley Capital. What changes will Hadley Capital make to my business? Hadley Capital is not going to run the company – the company’s management team will. Hadley Capital will be there to partner with the management team to determine any changes that need to be made to the business. Learn more about our partnership model. What is it like to work with Hadley Capital? Of course, we think it’s great. And the managers of our companies would agree (at least that’s what they tell us…). Most of our companies’ presidents enjoy having Hadley Capital as partner and sounding board. Conversations are as frequent as necessary – sometimes daily and in other instances once a month. The presidents also interact among themselves. We have found this sharing of ideas and best practices to be in everybody’s best interest. Our performance expectations are clear and objectively reasonable. What are Hadley Capital's ongoing reporting requirements? All of our companies are audited and prepare detailed monthly financial statements, annual budgets, etc. Some portfolio companies also prepare a weekly, one page, ‘flash’ report. In general our reporting requirements are not burdensome and the data they generate are useful to management. How does Hadley Capital add value to a company? Hadley Capital’s role varies depending upon the needs of each company. At times we are the outsourced CFO, the business development team, or a strategic consultant. At all times we are interested and active board members. We believe that our collective experience allows us to offer sound and prudent advice and guidance that, over time, adds value to each company. You can send us additional questions via our contact page, or email us at inquiries@hadleycapital.com.

With more than 30 small business acquisitions over its history  and an active fund in the marketplace (Hadley Capital Fund IV), Hadley continues to set the  standard for success in the small business acquisition ecosystem. Hadley’s recently announced Hadley Independent Sponsor Alliance exemplifies its commitment  to fostering growth and creating value in the lower middle market. Tailored to meet the unique  needs of experienced independent sponsors, this program provides both the capital required to  close transactions and a robust framework for driving success post-acquisition. The Lower Middle Market Opportunity McGuire Woods notes the “vast majority of independent sponsor transactions are occurring in the  lower middle market… more than 75% of the transactions surveyed involved target companies with  an enterprise value between $10 million and $75 million.” This segment of the market is rich with  opportunity, offering independent sponsors the chance to target companies with strong growth  potential but likely lack access to traditional investment avenues. Hadley Capital focuses on transactions requiring $2–$10 million in equity, an investment range  perfectly aligned to the lower middle market “sweet spot”. With the Independent Sponsor Alliance,  Hadley empowers capable sponsors to unlock value in portfolio companies while leveraging the  firm’s extensive expertise in small company acquisitions. What Hadley Brings to the Table 1. Professional Due Diligence Practices Hadley’s access to highly vetted and trusted service providers, along with Hadley’s own thorough  due diligence approach, ensures an accurate assessment of the strengths and risks of target  companies. This rigorous process sets the stage for negotiating legal agreements, efficiently raising  debt financing, and an accurate and timely closing of the acquisition. 2. Deep Financing Relationships Financing is often a key hurdle in closing a small business acquisition. Hadley’s deep, well established relationships with debt providers enable sponsors to secure favorable terms and  structure deals effectively. Hadley’s tenured track record of success in the lower middle market and  our reputation for treating lenders as true partners in each acquisition sets us apart. Independent  sponsors working with Hadley will benefit from our “seal of approval” within the debt financing  community. 3. Legal and Corporate Structuring Expertise From complex legal arrangements to tax-efficient structuring, Hadley’s team of legal and tax  experts - including expertise in QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) tax treatment - offers  independent sponsors a critical edge. 4. Post-Closing Management Enhancements – The Hadley Ownership System Hadley’s extensive network of management resources allows for seamless team enhancements  post-acquisition. Whether it’s finding key personnel or improving operational strategies, Hadley’s  support ensures target companies are well-positioned for growth. At the heart of Hadley’s value creation model is the Hadley Ownership System, a proprietary  framework for developing and growing companies. This system focuses on aligning leadership,  streamlining operations, and driving sustainable growth. 5. Alignment of Goals and Values Hadley’s partnership philosophy prioritizes alignment between all stakeholders, fostering  collaboration and trust throughout the transaction process and beyond. Economic Alignment: A Shared Path to Success Hadley’s Independent Sponsor Alliance is structured to align interests of all parties, ensuring that  every stakeholder—from the sponsor to the target company management team—benefits from the  success of the transaction. The program’s economics reflect the standards of the independent  sponsor community while introducing elements designed to foster trust and collaboration. Key Economic Features Closing Fees: Independent sponsors receive a competitive percentage of closing fees, with  Hadley participating proportionately. Closing Fee Rollover: Independent sponsors are encouraged to roll over a portion of their  closing fees as pari-passu equity. Management Fees: Shared management fees subject to the target company’s EBITDA. Equity Participation: Independent sponsors enjoy pari-passu equity participation rights for  all closing fee rollovers and hard investments in the target company. Equity Promote: Sponsor equity promote tied to long-term value creation. Transaction Expenses: Hadley shoulders pre-closing costs, including due diligence and  legal expenses, reducing the financial burden on sponsors during the deal process. Proven Success: A Recent Case Study Hadley recently partnered with an experienced independent sponsor to complete a significant  lower middle market acquisition, demonstrating the program’s potential. In this case, Hadley provided over $12 million in equity financing and facilitated an additional $25 million in debt  financing. This collaborative effort enabled the sponsor to close the deal efficiently and establish a  solid foundation for post-acquisition growth. Less than a year later, the partnership formed  between Hadley and the independent sponsor has resulted in a successful transition from the  target company founders and a greater than 20% per annum revenue growth rate. Ideal Transactions for the Program Hadley’s Independent Sponsor Alliance is designed for transactions that meet the following criteria: Market Purchase Price: Fair and reasonable valuations Growth Potential: Clear opportunities for expansion and operational improvement Target Industries: Light manufacturing, business services, and specialty distribution Alignment: Shared values and strategic goals between the sponsor and Hadley Independent sponsors with deals under Letter of Intent (LOI) are encouraged to engage with Hadley  early in the process. The firm evaluates opportunities quickly and confidentially, ensuring timely  feedback and decision-making. Why Choose Hadley? Hadley Capital offers independent sponsors a unique combination of resources, expertise, and  alignment that is unmatched in the lower middle market. By partnering with Hadley, sponsors can: Close with Confidence: Secure the financial and operational backing needed to navigate  the acquisition and get it to the finish line. Enhance Target Companies: Leverage Hadley’s post-closing resources and decades of  experience to drive growth and create value.

This is especially true in the midst of the Baby Boomer Retirement Crisis and it’s for this reason we have decided to write on what to keep in mind during this unique transition. More than 40% of all small businesses are owned by baby boomers - those post-WWII kids born from 1946 to 1964 - according to a report conducted by Guidant Financial. About 10 years ago, we wrote a blog post covering how the baby boomer transition might impact small business succession planning and small business mergers and acquisitions. Today, this demographic fact presents a ticking time bomb for small business succession and transition planning and presents a potential retirement crisis for baby boomers: 10,000+ baby boomers turn 65 years old every day and the oldest boomers will turn 75 in 2021. Many Baby Boomers retired in the third quarter of last year which means that their millions of dollars worth of assets transferred. In this blog post, we will cover all the following topics for any businesses planning their exit strategy: What is Business Succession Planning? How to Write a Business Succession Plan The Three Most Common Situations in Management Succession and Ownership Transition Options for Baby Boomers Seeking Management Succession and Ownership Transition What is Business Succession Planning? At the most basic level, business succession planning is the process whereby a business owner develops a plan for someone else to manage or run the business when the owner is ready to retire (or upon more serious situations like disability or death). A more comprehensive business succession or transition plan will also take into consideration tax and estate planning, business valuation, and personal goals including philanthropy, hobbies and family legacy. We consider business succession planning to typically include two elements: Management Succession and Ownership Transition. These two elements may occur simultaneously or individually but each element is an essential part of all succession plans. How to Write a Business Succession Plan There are lots of resources available to small business owners on how to write a business succession plan. Here are a few resources to get you started: National Federation of Independent Business: Webinar on Succession Planning Process Succession Planning SCORE: Succession Planning Guide There are also many questions to consider when building a Business Succession Plan. Trusted advisors to small business owners are also a very good resource when developing plans. Small business accountants and attorneys are good sources of advice and can provide valuable insight into what to consider when developing a comprehensive plan. The Three Most Common Situations in Management Succession and Ownership Transition Every small business that Hadley Capital works with faces some element of succession or transition. The three most common situations in small business succession can be seen below: Family Business Succession Planning Family business succession generally involves passing management of the business from one generation to the next generation. According to a report from the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago, three-quarters of family-owned manufacturing companies had baby boomer owners and, and of those, half had no plans for succession. Overall, 62 percent of family-owned manufacturing companies had not designated a specific successor. Family businesses in need of management succession often look to the next generation to run the business. Many times, the next generation is already involved in some facet of the business operations so should be prepared to take over management. But, this is not always the case. The next generation may need to be recruited back to the family business. Or, there may be multiple members of the next generation actively involved, presenting some tricky family dynamics. An added complication in family business succession plans is dealing with ownership transition among multiple generations, particularly if the retiring generation needs cash from the sale of a family business in order to comfortably retire. Hadley Capital has helped multiple family businesses - from 2nd generation up to 6th generation - achieve a successful management succession and concurrent ownership transition. Read more about how we helped the Feldman family in the transition of their family business. Owner-Managed Business Succession Planning Owner-Managed Businesses run by Baby Boomers may face the most pressing succession issues. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, baby boomers own 2.34 million small businesses in the United States, employing more than 25 million people. And, a recent survey by Wilmington Trust suggests that nearly 60% of boomers do not have a succession plan. In our experience, the reason many owner-managed small businesses lack a plan is because these businesses rarely have the management depth to complete a management succession from the owner-manager to an existing employee. A management succession plan for an owner-manager typically involves recruiting someone from outside the business to run the day-to-day operations of the business, allowing the owner-manager to retire. However, since the business is usually the owner-manager's primary financial asset, the owner-manager must also complete a simultaneous ownership transition in order to secure retirement funds. This presents a particularly complicated problem because the owner-manager is important to the business but also wants to step away. Hadley Capital has partnered with more than a dozen owner-managers to address the competing goals of most owner-managers: transitioning day-to-day management and securing retirement funds through the sale or recapitalization of the business. We are experts at management succession and ownership transition in small companies, read about one such success story with JRI Industries. Business Succession Planning for Businesses with Inactive Owners Businesses with inactive owners have typically already passed through a successful management succession. However, it is not uncommon for businesses with inactive owners to reach a point where the inactive owners want to sell the business, the managers of the business are ready to retire, and/or the managers want to grow the business but the inactive owners are comfortable with the current state. At this juncture, the company must complete an ownership transition: either the management team and the owners sell the company to a new owner, and/or the managers may elect to buy the company from the inactive owners. If management is ready to retire, the inactive owners are faced with developing a management succession plan. Over the years, Hadley Capital has helped a number of management teams acquire the businesses they are running from inactive owners. In each case, management had a desire to become owners of the business and to pursue their growth plans just as we achieved in partnership with the management team at Bluff Manufacturing. Options for Baby Boomers Seeking Management Succession and Ownership Transition There is no one-size-fits-all solution for baby boomers seeking management succession and ownership transition. As outlined in the prior section, the circumstances of each individual business will vary greatly and, thus, there may be many potential options for management succession and ownership transition or only a select number of options. Below is a list of 8 common management succession and ownership transition options: Hire a new manager/management team and retain ownership: This option addresses management succession but does not address ownership transition. However, a successful management transition would enable a future ownership transition. Sell to a family member(s): Generational transition achieves the management succession goal. But, most often, the next generation does not have the cash to fund the ownership transition. The most likely solution is for the departing generation to “fund” the ownership transition with a seller note that is repaid over time. Sell your portion of the business to your partner(s): This is a fairly common path among owner/partners, particularly when one partner is older than the other. But, much like a family business, the remaining partner frequently does not have the cash to fund the ownership transition and the departing partner may “fund” the ownership transition with a seller note that is repaid over time. Sell to your employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP): ESOPs have significant economic benefits related to preferential tax treatment of ESOP contributions and distributions but are also complex and difficult and expensive to maintain. Learn more about ESOPs and some of their challenges in a blog post we wrote a few years ago. Sell to your management team via a management buyout: A management buyout can be an ideal way to address the management succession needs of business owners. But, again, much like a family business, the management team likely does not have the cash to fund the ownership transition and the owner may need to “fund” the ownership transition with a seller note that is repaid over time. Sell to a strategic acquirer:  Selling a small business to a strategic acquirer (typically a larger company in your industry) can be an effective way to address management succession because the strategic acquirer can typically provide management oversight. It can also be an effective way to address ownership transition because strategic buyers typically pay cash. Sell to a private investor like Hadley Capital: Experienced small company investors like Hadley Capital are well-positioned to achieve both management succession and ownership transitions through a sale or partial sale/recapitalization. Hadley Capital can provide management transition support and, at the same time, has the capital necessary to fully fund, in cash, the ownership transition. Hadley Capital also has a substantial amount of flexibility to address the unique situations and circumstances facing business owners, families, and management teams. Do nothing: Believe it or not, in our experience, this is usually the most common option selected by owner-managers and family businesses. The data regarding the lack of succession plans among small businesses that were referenced earlier in this article would support this position. However, the demographic trends facing small businesses should necessitate a determined focus on developing management succession and ownership transition plans. Hadley Capital has decades of experience in addressing management succession and ownership transition with small business owners and managers. Achieving a successful management succession and ownership transition plan that addresses the needs of all the stakeholders in a small business requires an experienced partner.

BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Cash Flow: What Does it Mean for Your Business? Harrison Menaker June 28, 2022 - 4 min read Do you struggle to balance your business expenses and cash every month? Do your monthly expenses outweigh the cash your business brings in? If so, chances are your business is facing cash flow issues. You are not alone - studies show that nearly 61% of businesses struggle with cash flow problems. What Is Cash Flow? Cash flow is the amount of money that flows in and out of your business every month. Cash flow can be broken down into two components: cash receipts and disbursements. Cash receipts represent the flow of cash into your business, while cash disbursements represent the outflow of cash from your business. When your cash receipts are more than disbursements, your cash flow is positive. When your receipts are less than disbursements, your cash flow is negative. Positive cash flow and negative cash flow are not inherently good or bad in any single period. Sustained positive cash flow is good, while sustained negative cash flow is bad. Cash Flow Management and Why It Matters Cash flow management refers to maintaining control over cash inflows and outflows. The primary goal of cash flow management is to effectively track the money coming into your business from sales against money going out of your business from bills, salaries, and other expenses. Cash flow management allows for a complete picture of how money travels through your business, making you more knowledgeable on the inner workings of your operations. Cash flow management is vital because: It ensures your business always has an appropriate level of cash on hand to meet its obligations. It helps you to track the performance of your business and make necessary adjustments. It provides visibility into the appropriate timing and results of future investments. Understanding the Main Cash Flow Levers Cash flow levers are aspects of a business that can positively or negatively impact your cash flow. Below we have outlined some primary cash flow levers found in most businesses: Inventory Lever Inventories are the items a business uses in its operations to provide a good or service to a customer. Whether it be raw materials used in production, manufactured goods awaiting further processing, or imported goods soon to be distributed, all these things are considered inventory. Inventory is an asset of a business. As inventory increases, cash decreases. As inventory decreases, cash increases. There are tradeoffs between having high levels of inventory and low levels of inventory. Accounts Receivable Lever Accounts receivable are payments from previous sales that are expected to be received by your business in the future. Accounts receivable are created when a business doesn’t receive immediate payment after providing a good or service to a customer. Accounts Receivable are an asset of a business. When A/R increases, cash decreases. When A/R decreases, cash increases. There are tradeoffs between having high levels of A/R and low levels of A/R. Accounts Payable Lever Accounts Payable are payments that are expected to be made by your business in the future. Accounts payable are created when a business buys supplies or inventory on credit. Accounts Payable are a liability of a business. As A/P increases, cash increases. As A/P decreases, cash decreases. Expense Control Lever Expenses represent the everyday costs of running a business and can include items such as payroll, rent, utilities, marketing, office supplies, among many others. Maintaining tight control of expenses helps improve cash flow. When cash flow is tight, reducing expenses will improve cash flow. Line Of Credit Lever A line of credit is a loan from a bank that provides an amount of credit (usually called a limit) that is accessed as needed and typically repaid over time. Businesses use lines of credit to meet working capital needs and take advantage of strategic investment opportunities. Lines of credit are an effective tool to provide stability in cash flow – when cash flow is low, a line of credit provides liquidity; when cash flow is high, the line of credit is repaid to provide liquidity for future periods of low cash flow. Statement of Cash Flows A statement of cash flows summarizes the amount of money coming into your company and the money going out. A statement of cash flows complements both the current period’s balance sheet and income statement. How a Statement of Cash Flow Works A cash flow statement is separated into three sets of activities in a business: Cash Flow from Operating Activities Operating activities within a Cash Flow Statement include the net result of profits minus expenses in any period, also commonly known as Net Income. Non-cash operating expenses such as depreciation and amortization are added back to Net Income. Operating activities also include changes in current asset and liability accounts from one reporting period to the next. Net Income + non-cash operating expenses + changes in current assets and liabilities = Cash flow from operating activities. Cash Flow from Investing Activities Investing activities within a Cash Flow Statement include any disbursements or receipts of cash due to any cash spent or received from the sale or purchase of fixed assets such as computers, equipment, vehicles, etc. Any investments made in non-operating assets, such as long-term financial investments, would also be reflected in the Cash Flow from investing activities. Cash Flow from Financing Activities Financing activities within a Cash Flow Statement include any receipts or disbursements of cash due to funding the business or returning value to shareholders. The two most common examples of financing activities are receiving and paying off loans from lenders, purchasing stock from shareholders, or paying dividends to shareholders. The sum of Cash flow from Operating Activities +/- Cash flow from Investment Activities +/- Cash flow from Financing Activities represents cash created or used during the period. When added or subtracted to existing cash on hand at the beginning of the period, the result is cash on hand at the end of the period (which represents the cash account on the balance sheet for the period). Using Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) To Understand Cash Flow Better The cash conversion cycle is a calculation that measures how many days your business takes to convert inventory into cash from sales. CCC expresses how much time the business uses to sell inventory, collect money from customers (receivables), and pay its bills (accounts payable). How to Calculate CCC CCC has three main elements: Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) This is the number of days needed to change inventory into sold goods. DIO = (Average Inventory ÷ Cost of Goods Sold) x 365 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) This is the average number of days a business takes to receive payment for sales made on the account. DSO = (Accounts Receivable ÷ Net Credit Sales) x 365 Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) This is the number of days a business uses to pay for products purchased from manufacturers or suppliers on the account. DPO = Ending Accounts Payable ÷ (Cost of Goods Sold ÷ 365) CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO The Cash Conversion Cycle is a reliable metric that shows how a business manages working capital and how long cash is tied up in the business. A lower CCC is better than a longer CCC. Cash Conversion Cycle Example: Bob’s Tees In one of our past blog posts about Asset-Based Valuations, we learned how to value a company’s assets by looking at a fictional business, Bob’s Tees R Us. Today we’ll revisit Bob’s Tees. However, this time, we will analyze the Cash Conversion Cycle. ·   Finding Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) o   DIO = (Average Inventory ÷ Cost of Goods Sold) x 365 §  =($800,000 ÷ $6,000,000) x 365 ·   It takes Bob’s Tees about 49 days to turn its inventory into sold goods. ·   Finding Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) o   DSO = (Accounts Receivable ÷ Net Credit Sales) x 365 §  =($1,200,000 ÷ $6,000,000) x 365 ·   It takes Bob’s Tees about 73 days to receive payment for its sales made on account. ·   Balance of sales are cash payments ·   Finding Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) o   DPO = End Accounts Payable ÷ (Cost of Goods Sold ÷ 365) §  =($1,500,000) ÷ ($6,000,000 ÷ 365) ·   It takes Bob’s Tees about 91 days to pay for its purchases made on account. ·   Putting it all Together o   CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO §  = 73 + 49 – 91 ·   It takes Bob’s Tees about 31 days to turn inventory into cash flow from sales. The 13-Week Cash Flow Statement A 13-week cash flow is a cash management tool that forecasts the cash flow of your business for the next 13 weeks. The 13-week cash flow is a living document and is an update, in some cases, on a daily basis but, at a minimum, on a weekly basis. A 13-week cash flow can be used in distressed, high-growth, and steady-state situations. Example of 13-Week Statement, with basis week and first projected week A 13-week cash flow statement has two primary components: cash coming into the business and cash going out of a business on a weekly basis. Examples of cash coming into a business include sales made, supplier refunds, or rebates. Examples of cash going out of a business include the cost of goods sold, utility expenses, and payroll. The timing of each inflow or outflow can be well understood (ex. timing of payroll) or less certain (ex. timing of customer payments). So, developing a 13-week cash flow involves some level of guesswork on timing and relies on business judgment. The current week’s actual cash flow serves as the starting point for the 13-week cash flow. From that benchmark, you can project the coming 13 weeks of cash receipts and disbursements based on your business’s historical performance and future projections. Use of 13-week cash flow in distressed situations: Ensure cash is available to meet operating needs Ensure sufficient cash to meet debt obligations To prioritize who gets paid and when they get paid To closely monitor the rate of collections of A/R Use of 13-week cash flow in high-growth situations: To ensure cash is available to fund growth in A/R, inventory, and expenses To keep track of increasing accounts receivable balances and make sure you are on top of collections. Use of 13-week cash flow in steady-state situations: To optimize cash flow To identify abnormal cash movements in the business To plan and prepare for lower cash periods or higher cash periods Don’t Allow Cash Flow to Kill Your Business Cash flow is the lifeline of any business. Effectively managing cash flow can seem like a daunting task but understanding the key levers of cash flow and tools to manage and improve cash flow will help any business at any stage of its lifecycle. If you’re curious about how your cash flow is affecting your business’s worth or ready to take more serious steps toward working with an investor to help your business grow, contact us today for a pressure-free consultation.

For individuals with business skills and a desire to make a meaningful impact, this can be less risky than starting a new business around an unproven product or service. ETA is typically pursued later in a person’s professional life after they gain operational experience and a more robust professional network. Over the past two decades, ETA has become a more well-trodden career path. In fact, ETA is now a common curriculum option at many graduate-level business schools. We called on our friend Professor Mark Smith, Ph. D, lecturer at the University of Illinois, to help us develop an outline for this blog post. This blog post will cover the basics about entrepreneurship through acquisition, various ETA models to consider, and other important considerations including deal flow and time commitment: Small Business and ETA Ideal ETA Targets Self-Funded Search Fund Model Traditional Search Fund Model Sponsored Search Fund Model Incubated Search Fund Model Crowd-Funded Search Fund Model Deal Flow ETA Time Commitment Small Business and ETA Small business and ETA go hand-in-hand because there are a lot of small businesses in need of ownership transition and management succession and the capital required to acquire a small business is lower. ETA is the beneficiary of a major demographic trend in the United States: more than 40% of all small businesses are owned by baby boomers. These baby boomer business owners are in need of management succession and ownership transition. And, a recent survey by Wilmington Trust suggests that nearly 60% of boomers do not have a succession plan. We’ve also written at greater length on baby boomers and succession planning. Enter ETA. ETA searches tend to focus on small businesses because access to investment capital is often a meaningful constraint for ETA candidates. This influences the size and type of business targeted for acquisition. But, with more than 30 million small businesses in America, how does an ETA searcher focus their limited time and resources? Ideal ETA Targets There are three high-level factors that come into play in a typical ETA search process: business characteristics, target industry, and geography. The characteristics of an ideal small business acquisition candidate for Hadley are similar to those of an ideal ETA target: Beyond the characteristics of the ideal business, a target industry is another consideration and can vary widely. Though Hadley is generally industry agnostic, ETA searchers may find that developing an industry focus (and expertise) is helpful in two important domains: quickly evaluating potential acquisition candidates differentiating themselves in a competitive acquisition process. Geographic focus may also be a significant consideration, particularly for someone later in their career or with important family considerations (kids in high school, for example). While a geographic preference can help focus the search, it can also introduce an extremely limiting element to the search. Generally, the tighter the geographic circle, the smaller number of potential acquisition candidates. And, since the odds of any potential acquisition candidate turns out to be “the one” are extremely small (more on this below), the challenges of a tight geographic preference become more acute. But, before beginning a search for a business, in a target industry, and specific geography,  most ETA candidates need to evaluate which ETA model is best suited to their needs and goals. There are several ETA models used for small business searches and acquisitions, let’s start with the most common: Self-Funded Search The self-funded search is just that, self-funded, and is the most common search model. Self-funded search is also often referred to as a “fundless sponsor”. That is, an individual looking to “sponsor” an acquisition but without the “funds” to complete it without support from a third party. Here we’ve written at greater lengths on private equity vs. fundless sponsors. The entrepreneur bears all the costs to find a suitable acquisition target. Once a business is found to purchase, the entrepreneur determines the best funding strategy for the acquisition. Deals are funded by a combination of personal funds, investor capital, seller financing, and bank financing. Nearly all small business acquisitions in any given year start as self-funded searches. Based on the most recent data from Mark Smith’s ETA course, it is estimated all other search models account for less than 100 acquisitions per year. Hadley interfaces with dozens of self-funded ETA searchers (also synonymous with “fundless sponsors”) every year. We have identified three important elements that a fundless sponsor or self-funded ETA search can bring to a potential acquisition opportunity: Identifying a proprietary acquisition opportunity Negotiating a value purchase price Contributing meaningful operating experience. Learn more about these three elements and how we think about working with self-funded searchers. Traditional Search Fund In the traditional search fund model, capital is raised from investors to fund the search phase. Expenditures in the search phase include searcher salaries, office space, travel expenses, and due diligence costs for a period of up to two years. Investors typically receive preferred equity in the acquisition equal to 1.5x their investment. They also typically receive the right of first refusal to invest additional capital in the acquisition. Tom Matlock, an Investor and CEO writes more about what he looks for in a search funder in his article “Defining Industry Boundaries for a Search Fund”. Below is a small preview of what he says: “What I’m really listening for is how the search funder thinks about the industry. What sectors do they find attractive and why? How are those sectors related in any way to their past experience, their network, the things that they have already done? How do they think about generating deal flow in these sectors? What are they actually planning on doing, when they hit the ground, to start the process that they hope will end with them buying a company and becoming CEO?” Although ETA search funds have become much more accepted in the alternative investing community, finding the right investor can still be a challenge. Search Fund is a good resource to start the search for investors. Starting a traditional search fund can be a daunting process, but luckily there are resources available to simplify the process. Stanford Business put out an article to do just that in  “What it Takes to Be a Search Fund Entrepreneur” where they discuss that sometimes, rather than starting your own business, it can be simpler to acquire another. Sponsored Search A sponsored search involves the searcher partnering with an investment firm (family office, a private equity firm, etc.). The firm provides all the capital for both the search and the acquisition and is, therefore, the controlling shareholder. The firm provides the searcher office space, administrative support, and/or infrastructure to conduct the search. As the controlling shareholder, the firm will control the Board of Directors. Hadley works with experienced industry executives in a hybrid version of the sponsored search model. In this case, Hadley provides our industry executive partners with access to our proprietary buyside relationships that can help quickly identify target companies for sale and facilitate introductions to owners. Our industry executive partners provide the industry knowledge and expertise that separates us (as a team) from other potential buyers. Once a target is identified, Hadley then provides resources to evaluate the target, conduct due diligence, and complete the acquisition. In addition, Hadley provides the bulk of the equity financing to complete the acquisition. At any time, we have at least one or two of these hybrid sponsored searches in process with experienced industry executives. In fact, I am currently working on a hybrid sponsored search in the sporting goods industry. If you are an experienced industry executive that is interested in pursuing an acquisition opportunity in your industry, and you need a good partner, please reach out to me to learn more about how Hadley can be helpful to you. Incubated Search An incubated search is similar to a sponsored search in that the searcher has committed capital for the search and acquisition. The difference is the searcher has office space with other searchers and benefits from shared search infrastructure, administrative support, and daily interaction with other searchers. The infrastructure and support are geared towards helping searchers and the incubator handles all the recruiting and hiring of search interns. Searchers share a database of potential acquisition targets. Crowd-funded Search The crowd-funded search is where the entrepreneur raises capital for the search and acquisition from crowdfunding sources. Search capital can be structured as preferred shares and/or convertible debt. Acquisition capital can be structured as common shares, preferred shares, or a combination with different liquidation preferences, PIK rates, etc. The Evolution of Entrepreneurship through Acquisition is another great resource to learn more about the various ETA models at length. Deal Flow Once the ETA search has commenced, the focus turns immediately to identifying potential acquisition opportunities. In industry lingo, this is referred to as “Deal Flow.” Earlier this week I talked to an ETA searcher trying to identify and acquire a small manufacturing business in Michigan and heard a common refrain: “I need more deal flow.” Though it might appear that determining the best ETA model to pursue or identify investors is the most challenging aspect of ETA, by far the most challenging is deal flow. Even more confounding is that deal flow represents a strange paradox: there are a huge number of small businesses in America and many of them are in need of management transition and ownership succession but identifying the best opportunities can feel like searching for a needle-in-a-haystack. Developing a robust deal flow pipeline will quickly become the number one focus of any ETA search. As previously mentioned, developing specific criteria (business characteristics, industry, etc.) can help focus the search. But, criteria that are too specific can quickly narrow the search to a level that will lead to a dramatic decline in deal flow. There are a number of places to get started in developing a strong deal flow pipeline. Take a look at the infographic below to learn more: Deal listing sites such as BizBuySell, BizQuest, and Axial can also be a good way to prime the deal flow search process. Hadley has been in the small company acquisition market for nearly 20 years and our deal flow pipeline is robust. As a result, we review thousands of acquisition opportunities every year yet we aim to acquire 1 - 2 companies per year. With this level of yield, it becomes extremely apparent how important deal flow is to a successful ETA outcome. And, it also influences the time commitment that someone needs to commit to ETA in order to be successful. ETA Time Commitment I talk with potential ETA searchers almost every month - from experienced industry executives, post-MBAs, and buddies considering a career change. I am frequently asked, “How long should I expect this process to take?” My answer is often sobering - it’s two years...and that’s if you are doing it full time. Hadley’s experience in acquiring small businesses is that it takes nearly one year, on average, from introduction to a small business owner considering a sale to actually closing the acquisition. And, as I said above, we have a robust deal flow pipeline. For an ETA candidate starting from a standing start, it would require him or her to identify an acquisition candidate within the first year of the search and then complete the necessary due diligence, organize the financing, get the legal done, etc. Assuming the deal doesn’t fall apart at any stage of the process, which is not uncommon. Entrepreneurship through Acquisition (ETA) is an exciting path to becoming an entrepreneur by buying and growing an established small business. Achieving a successful ETA outcome requires a lot of hard work and discipline but the potential rewards can be well worth the effort.

You can see the video here. We have previously talked about the importance of financial reporting, but Privcap makes a good point about the importance of having finance talent. For most private equity firms financial information is the lifeblood of the business. At Hadley Capital, our first choice would be to retain the existing controller of CFO. Our evaluation process typically works something like this: Working with the controller during due diligence and closing. During this time we get a pretty good understanding of how the company currently is managing its finances. We see their monthly reports including – income statement, balance sheet, accounts receivable aging report, accounts payable aging report, and pipeline reports. At this stage, we are evaluating how accurate the reporting is, what information the controller is tracking and what kind of ability the company has to create useful financial reports. Working with the controller post closing. Post closing the monthly financial reporting requirements typically change for the controller in a couple ways. First, financials are typically required within 30 days of month end. Previously the company may have been more lax on the timeliness of reporting. Now not only Hadley Capital, but also the lenders require the financial information on time. Second, the controller will also often have to provide new financial reporting. For example, quarterly financial covenant calculations will likely be part of the new financing agreement. We work directly with our controllers during this time to make sure they understand what kind of information we need and why we need it. Usually within 90 days of closing we have a pretty good feel for the capability of the controller. In many cases the controller has the necessary skills to take on the additional financial requirements. If not, we will either a) work with the controller to acquire new skills or b) make the necessary change to find a new controller. Getting the finance team right is an important first step in professionalizing a small business and it is one of the the things we like to work on with our portfolio companies.

Lifetime Value of a Customer (LTV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) are used interchangeably but are the same concepts. Throughout this post, we will use LTV. A good LTV is an LTV that is growing over time. This post includes examples for calculating LTV, ways to improve LTV over time, and additional related topics including: Lifetime Value of a Customer Formula Is LTV Revenue or Profit? What is An Example of LTV? Customer Acquisition Costs Average Order Value and Gross Profits Customer Retention Churn Rate Customer Segmentation Net Present Value Internal Rate of Return Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Understanding Customer Lifetime Value for Your Business Lifetime Value of a Customer Formula Is LTV revenue or profit? In its simplest terms, LTV is how much a customer is worth to its supplier. Note that the LTV is not derived from a revenue number, but a profit contribution number. This distinction is very important. A customer’s contribution to the profit of a business needs to incorporate all variable costs associated with that customer including but not limited to material costs, labor, fulfillment costs, shipping, customer acquisition costs, sales commissions, etc. LTV is also the most a business should pay (or invest) to acquire a customer. Better understanding your customer through analysis and customer segmentation also plays an important role in growing LTV.  These topics are explored further below. What is an Example of LTV? The business world loves acronyms and buzzwords.  Many are meaningless or trendy. On the other hand, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) aka the Lifetime Value of a Customer (LTV) is an acronym that is critical to running a successful business. Let's discuss an example to explain why. Bob’s Tees R Us distributes unfinished wood 3” golf tees. That is all they do. They buy in bulk, repackage the product into bags of 20 tees, and sell these tees directly to the end-user (golfer). Over the past four years, the company had financial and operational results as per the table below. The company has been able to grow and can continue to grow without adding fixed costs. This means the gross profit of each additional order drops to the bottom line. Bob has collected meaningful data about his business. The question, of course, is how he uses it to make management decisions to improve his business. Before launching into a calculation of LTV, it’s important to understand the key inputs that contribute to and may influence LTV. Let’s dig into Bob’s Tees numbers below: Average Order Size = Revenue / # of Orders In 2020, ($19,500 / 1,776) = $10.98 Order Frequency = # of Orders / # of Customers In 2020, (1,776 / 1,703) = 1.04 Gross Profit Per Customer = Gross Profit / # of Customers In 2020, ($8,190 / 1,776) = $4.81 Retention = (Customers Last Year - Lost Customers) / Customers Last Year In 2020, (1,533 - 499) / 1,533 = .674 = 67.4% Average Customer Life = Customers Last Year / Lost Customers In 2020, 1,533 / 499 = 3.07 Using the historical data, and knowing that his average customer life is three years, Bob develops a three year forecast for Gross Profit per Customer. Bob also knows that his cost of capital is about 16% so he uses this as his discount rate. More discussions of discount rates are included below. Bob calculates the present value of the Gross Profit per Customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and sums these three values to arrive at a LTV of $11.96. See the chart and formula below. The sections below address several important concepts that contribute to calculating LTV and factors that may impact LTV. Customer Acquisition Costs Customer acquisition costs include all expenses associated with identifying and converting prospects into actual customers. These costs (or investments) can include but are not limited to: Buying mailing lists and sending out printed catalogs Online advertising like pay per click (PPC) Direct salespeople and their expenses If the LTV of Bob’s customers is currently $11.96, in theory, Bob should be willing to spend up to that amount to acquire a new customer. Accurately tracking and continually lowering customer acquisition costs can improve LTV. Average Order Value and Gross Profit Average order value (AOV) and gross profit are key metrics and increasing either one (or both) can have a significant impact on the profitability of the company. Average Order Value = Total Revenue / # of Orders In our example above in 2020: ($19,500/1,776) = $10.98 Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold Gross Profit is the profit a company makes after deducting all the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is the total of all costs associated with making a good or service and usually includes materials, labor, and overhead. Bob would like to increase both his order value and his gross profit margin. Bob knows that some golfers like 4” tees and he thinks they may like them in different colors. In addition, a customer asks Bob if he sells ball mark repair tools. Bob adds a few of these to his product mix. After researching competitors, Bob feels he can charge a premium for these new items. Bob is very pleased to see that the new products appear to be a success. In the first month after introducing these products, his Average Order Value (AOV) increases to $17.00 and the gross margin percentage increases to 49%. Assuming the same average customer life and order frequency, what impact do these changes have on Bob’s LTV? Gross Profit Per Customer = AOV x Gross Profit % $17 x 49% = $8.30 Bob added tremendous value to his business by nearly doubling the LTV just by adding a few additional products to his offering. Customer Retention Customer retention is another variable that has a significant impact on LTV. Customer Retention is engaging existing customers to continue purchasing your goods or services. Customer Retention = (Customers Last Year - Lost Customers) / Customers Last Year In 2020 Bob’s Tees had a customer retention rate of 67.4%. (1,533 - 499) / 1,533 = .674 = 67.4% Churn Rate Churn Rate is the percentage of customers who terminate their relationship in any given period. Churn Rate = 1 - Retention Rate. In 2020, Bob’s Tees had a Churn Rate of 32.6% 1 - .674 = .326 = 32.6% The current customer is often the best customer and keeping them adds to LTV.  Below are some of the ways companies retain customers: Good customer service Same day shipping Product quality Product variety, Competitive prices Bob is so happy with the success of his new product offerings and the big jump in AOV that he decides to go fishing for two months. Since he has no employees, no orders will ship during these two months. He anticipates that these customers may be unhappy and probably will not return. However, he does not care – his LTV is now more than $20 per customer! When he returns from the fishing trip, he sees his customer ratings have plummeted and social media is roasting him. Doing some quick calculations, Bob thinks that his customer retention has been cut in half! New Customer Retention = 67.4% / 2 = 33.7% # of Lost Customers = # of Customers * Churn Rate = 1,533 * (1 - .337) = 1,016 New Average Customer Life = # of Customers / Lost Customers 1,533 / 1,016 = 1.5 years The average customer life was cut in half, too! What does this mean to Bob’s LTV? Bob got a quick lesson in the value of retaining existing customers. This was an expensive fishing trip! His LTV declined from more than $20 to $11.62 because his Average Customer Life declined from 3 years to 1.5 years. Customer Segmentation Customer Segmentation is studying your customers and dividing them into various segments or groups with common characteristics. Bob liked things better when the LTV was growing, not shrinking, and he decided he needed to make some better decisions. Attending webinars and reading business books introduced Bob to the important concept of customer segmentation. In customer segmentation, companies use common customer characteristics to target their market more effectively and better meet the needs of their customers based on who they are and where they’re from. Segmentation studies can be very detailed and often include data like age, race, gender, marital status, occupation, etc. Bob’s business decided to start simple:  where do its customers live? After reviewing all of his shipment history, Bob was surprised to learn that 60% of his customers live in Texas, 30% in Florida, and the balance elsewhere. Bob decided to allocate more marketing and customer acquisition resources to Texas since so many of his customers are located there. He tested this strategy by introducing a burnt orange tee and purchasing banner ads on the local Texas golf association website to announce this new product. Testing ideas, tracking the outcomes, and regularly calculating the impact on LTV are necessary to continually fine-tune and incrementally improve the business and increase LTV. Early results indicate that Texans love a burnt orange tee. And, better yet, they will pay more for a burnt orange tee than a plain white tee even though Bob’s costs are the same. Bob has done enough LTV calculations to know that when his gross margin per customer goes up, his LTV goes up! Bob is also smart enough to know that the discount rate he uses to calculate the present value of future customer cash flows will have a significant influence on his LTV. To make sure he’s using an accurate discount rate, Bob refreshes his knowledge of net present value, discount rates, and weighted average cost of capital. Net Present Value At its core, LTV is a Net Present Value calculation. Bob is using Net Present Value (NPV) to decide how to allocate capital - a limited resource for Bob - into competing projects for growing LTV. Net Present Value is a method of calculating your profitability for a project or expenditure. Because projects have various budgets and timelines, calculating net present value (NPV) is a helpful tool to get an “apples to apples” comparison. NPV compares the present value of the cash flows at the required rate of return (also called the discount rate) of your project to your initial investment to determine whether to make the investment. Read more about NPV here. Projects with a negative NPV are typically not pursued. NPV in conjunction with internal rate of return (IRR) allows management to select the projects with the highest return and the greatest impact on the business – typically the largest NPV and the highest IRR. Internal Rate of Return Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is used in financial analysis to estimate the profitability of projects or investments. The internal rate of return is a discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all the project cash flows equal to zero. More on IRR is available here.If the IRR of a project exceeds Bob’s discount rate of 16% then the project is a go. If it does not, then Bob will pass on the project. Calculating the LTV of a customer on a net present value basis gives management the tool it needs to determine how much to invest in customer acquisition – or whether or not customer acquisition is even a top priority. One of the best ways for calculating the discount rate is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Weighted Average Cost of Capital Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) calculates a firm's cost of capital in which each category of capital is proportionately weighted. All sources of capital, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and any other long-term debt, are included in a WACC calculation. In its simplest form, WACC factors in: The Cost of Debt (the interest rate you pay the bank) The Cost of Equity (the return your investors want on their invested equity capital) What Portion of the Capital Structure Each Represents. To see how the math is broken down, see the example below. Bob’s analysis assumes the following capital structure for Bob’s Tees: To explain this further, the following formula is used for calculating WACC: Debt                                   Equity WACC = (% of Capital Structure x Cost) + (% of Capital Structure x Cost) So, when Bob plugs in the numbers from the table above we see the following: \ Debt                              Equity WACC =           (.64 x .08)              +     (.36 x .30) = .1592 Because this number is generally represented as a percentage, we then take the decimal times 100 as shown below. WACC =           .1592 x 100 =15.9% By calculating WACC, Bob confirms that his discount rate is 15.9%. The lower Bob’s discount rate, the higher his LTV. To the extent that Bob can source cheaper sources of financing, like debt financing, to replace more expensive costs of financing, like equity financing, the more he can increase his LTV. Understanding Customer Lifetime Value for Your Business Customer Lifetime Value and the impact operating decisions have on it, are important concepts for management teams to understand and to use in daily decision-making. LTV is a dynamic output, not an input. LTV will change over time depending on the success (or failures) of management decisions and the impact on key variables such as retention rates, AOV, gross profit, and discount rates. Being aware of your LTV ultimately helps the financial health of your business allowing you to make informed financial decisions.

One of the most difficult steps can be understanding and negotiating a letter of intent – the document that outlines the terms and conditions of an offer from a buyer and to a seller. Over two blog posts, I am going to attempt to explain, in plain English, the components of a Hadley Capital letter of intent. I’ll use this generic letter of intent as a template. The first post will cover: the structure of the transaction (asset sale or stock sale) the form of consideration paid to the seller (cash, seller debt, consulting payments, earn-outs) what the buyer is purchasing (everything) and not purchasing (everything else). The second post will cover: adjustments to the purchase price (working capital adjustments and net debt) sources of buyer financing (equity/cash and borrowed money) how the deal gets done (conditions to closing and exclusivity) Structure of Transaction: right up front this letter of intent states that Hadley Capital is buying the target company’s assets. I will cover asset sales versus stock sales in another post but, quickly, the vast majority of businesses in the U.S. are S corporations, and the seller of an S Corp is generally neutral (in terms of taxes) regarding a sale of assets or a sale of stock.  However, a buyer benefits from buying assets instead of stock…again, more in a future post. Total Consideration: Hadley Capital is offering the seller total sale proceeds of $5.0 million: $4.0 million in cash plus a seller note of $500,000 and a consulting and non-compete agreement of $500,000.  A large percentage of small business sales include some form of seller financing – in this case a seller note and a consulting and non-compete agreement. While overall market estimates vary, nearly all Hadley Capital acquisitions include a small portion of seller financing. A__ssets being Purchased: All of the assets required to operate the business are sold including hard assets like machinery to operating assets like inventory to intellectual property assets like customer lists. Certain assets may not be included in a sale, such as buildings and land (a buyer may elect to rent the existing facility from the seller) and personal assets like cars and boats. In most asset transactions, the sale is structured as a debt-free/cash-free transaction where the seller keeps all debt and all cash. This concept can be a little tricky, I will cover this topic in a future post… Liabilities being Assumed: Again, like most asset purchases, the only liabilities acquired by the buyer are accounts payable. All other liabilities, whether known or unknown, stay with the seller. For example, a seller would be required to repay all debt, settle all accrued vacation and paid-time-off pay, etc. That's a lot for one sitting (for you and for me). I'll pick up Part II in another post… Paul Wormley - Managing Partner Paul joined Hadley in 2005.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/anatomy-of-a-letter-of-intent-part-ii TITLE: Anatomy of a Letter of Intent Part II BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Anatomy of a Letter of Intent Part II Paul Wormley March 28, 2011 - 1 min read In the first post on the Anatomy of a Letter of Intent we covered the form of the transaction, how a seller is paid and what a buyer buys and doesn’t buy.  In this post, we will cover common purchase price adjustments, the sources of financing used by buyers and how a deal gets done. We will continue to use this generic letter of intent as a template. ** **Purchase Price Adjustments: Let’s start with the easy one first…This asset transaction is structured as a debt-free/cash-free transaction so the Net Debt adjustment is meant to clarify what is considered debt and, therefore, remains an obligation of the seller not to be acquired by the buyer. If the buyer has to settle any debts, the purchase price would be reduced by these amounts. Working capital adjustments are used in nearly all transactions to adjust the purchase price for movements in the working capital accounts (usually accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable) between the execution of the letter of intent and closing. A working capital adjustment is designed to ensure that a business is sold with an appropriate level of working capital (usually defined as the working capital target). It is not designed to benefit or penalize either the buyer or seller. This is another tricky topic that I will cover in a future post. Sources of Financing: This section is intended to provide the seller with comfort that Hadley Capital has the expertise and resources required to finance the acquisition. If a buyer will not or cannot provide specifics regarding their proposed sources of financing, a seller should question that buyer’s ability to complete the acquisition. Conditions to Closing: This portion of the letter of intent highlights the expectations and obligations of both the buyer and seller and are often specific to the circumstances of the individual business. The conditions also outline important procedural items from due diligence to financing to negotiating legal documents (like a definitive purchase agreement). Exclusivity: Buyers and sellers agree to a 90 – 120 days of exclusivity in order to focus their efforts on the steps required to get from a letter of intent to a closing. Generally, these steps include due diligence, financing and legal documentation. Hadley Capital typically closes a transaction 90 days after signing a letter of intent. Miscellaneous Terms: This is pretty straight forward. Hopefully Part I and Part II of this post are helpful to business owners contemplating a sale of their business or actively negotiating a letter of intent. It's obviously not a replacement for good legal counsel in a sale transaction…a topic probably worth yet another post. Paul Wormley - Managing Partner Paul joined Hadley in 2005.

BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ What Is the Difference Between an Asset Sale and a Stock Sale? Paul Wormley April 05, 2011 - 1 min read In Part I of the Anatomy of a Letter of Intent post I suggested that a buyer benefits from buying assets versus buying stock in the acquisition of an S Corporation (or other flow through entities like LLCs). Before I start, a disclaimer is probably in order. In business school I took tax accounting (FNCE 447) as a pass/fail class and, as I remember, barely passed. So consider the source and I’ll try to dig up the transcript to prove it… This is going to be a very high level overview of asset versus stock sales. If you want a crazy detailed version check out this book from my tax accounting course (it's actually a great reference book, and priced like one!). It may be easiest and most instructive to understand how C Corporation acquisitions are treated because they tend to be a little more straightforward. When selling a C Corporation, the seller has a strong tax incentive to sell stock versus assets. Why? Because if assets are sold, the C Corporation that sold the assets can only distribute the proceeds of the asset sale to its shareholders through dividends. This results in double taxation – once when the assets are sold and once when the dividends are distributed to shareholders. Painful. In an S Corporation, the seller is generally neutral to selling stock versus selling assets because the tax treatment of the sale is often similar and the S Corp form avoids double taxation because everything flows through to the shareholders’ personal returns. However, a buyer receives two primary benefits from buying assets: _Asset Write Up _– the buyercan write up the value of the assets to fair market value. This is beneficial because the buyer can then depreciate the assets, lowering taxable income and, thus, cash taxes. Liability Shield– the buyer of the assets is only buying the indentified assets. All liabilities (except usually working capital liabilities like accounts payable) stay with the seller. Liabilities can range from outstanding debt to environmental liabilities to unknown liabilities. The benefits to the buyer of leaving behind these liabilities is obvious. Of course, like anything that involves the IRS, there are lots and lots of exceptions & like 338(h)(10) elections in stock sales to get asset sale benefits. I have presented a plain-vanilla scenario, we’ll leave the complex stuff for the accountants and attorneys. Paul Wormley - Managing Partner Paul joined Hadley in 2005.

As Baby Boomers enter retirement age, we agree with the many experts who expect a proverbial title wave of companies coming to market.  According to a Cornell University research study, over $10 trillion in assets will change hands due to this generational trend.  Other experts talk in terms of 7-9 million such businesses coming up for sale in the next 10-12 years. It is hard to know what impact this will have on the small business M&A marketplace, but it might mean that, due to the sheer volume of companies for sale, purchase prices will decline.  If so, Baby Boomers who are otherwise already motivated to sell or otherwise transition their businesses should probably consider acting sooner rather than later, particularly with tax rates near historically low levels. Alan Brind, a business broker, wrote a good blog on this topic and provides recommendations on how to start building an exit plan.

In 2013, Hadley and the management team of Centare acquired Centare Group from a husband and wife founder team that sought to sell the business in order to fund their retirement and leave their organization and its team in good hands. Working with our management partners, Centare became a go-to provider of software development and cloud migration services to industry-leading companies in financial services, healthcare, and industrial markets. A strong workplace culture and exciting project opportunities also led to Centare being regularly recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work” for in-demand software developers. After nine years of successful ownership, we agreed to sell Centare to Rural Sourcing, lnc., a large strategic acquirer backed by Bain Capital. Centare was established in 1999 to provide custom software development by use of agile techniques and agile transformation for teams and firms. Centare is headquartered in Brookfield with an additional office in Madison, WI. The company works closely with the region's premier organizations and provides high-value strategy, digital product management, application modernization, DevOps transformations, software development, and has experience working with all the leading cloud computing platforms. Centare employs more than 100 Centarians and, for five consecutive years, the company has been classified among the top workplaces in Milwaukee. Rural Sourcing Acquires Centare Rural Sourcing was attracted to Centare's premium customer base and talented group of developers. The company regarded the acquisition as an opportunity to add two Middle America Locations to Rural Sourcing's onshore delivery center network. The acquisition will provide Centare’s customers with access to an inclusive set of capabilities and resources, and its workers will have access to expanded professional opportunities. Rural Sourcing CEO stated that despite the challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company had seen immense growth in the demand for digital engineering. Through the onshore framework that brings technology jobs to Middle America, Rural Sourcing is developing a new tech hub, expanding opportunities for skilled workers and delivering world-class development work for their customers. The acquisition of Centare facilitates the expansion of Rural Sourcing to the Midwest and has a strong cohesion in terms of culture, colleagues, and society. Centare's CEO, Tim Eiring, confirms that Rural Sourcing is a great fit for the company and its colleagues. "Our organization has a rich history of building relationships and delivering results. By joining Rural Sourcing, we are bringing new resources to our customers and colleagues while expanding our ability to scale. Culturally, the two firms are well-aligned, meaning it will be a smooth transition for our colleagues and customers. I'm excited to be part of the combined corporation and Rural Sourcing's high growth trajectory." In 2019, Bain Capital Double Impact, the impact investing arm of Bain Capital, purchased a majority stake in Rural Sourcing, allowing the organization to expand its national footprint and digital services while creating high-quality jobs and new technology corridors across the state. Hadley’s Partnership with Centare Hadley partners with small companies like Centare that are in need of ownership transition, management succession, and growth support. Hadley partnered with Centare’s management team to acquire the business from the company’s founder. With Centare's unique combination of engineering, product management, and talented employees, Hadley and our management partners built an organization with a cohesive culture, colleagues, and community. "In Hadley, we found a true partner that enabled Centare's transition from a founder-led organization to a new leadership team. With Hadley's guidance and support, we maintained our great culture while strategically growing Centare's business," said Tim Eiring, CEO of Centare. Centare is just one success story. Hadley also helps small company owners in need of management succession and/or support to pursue growth strategies. If you are an owner of a small company in need of ownership transition, management succession and/or growth support or a senior manager considering a buyout of a company that you run, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more about how we might be able to help you.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/financial-reporting TITLE: Financial Reporting Requirements in Small Company Acquisition BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Financial Reporting Requirements in Small Company Acquisition Scott Dickes October 13, 2015 - 1 min read Small business owners are often apprehensive about the changes that may occur when their business is acquired by a private equity firm.  When Hadley Capital acquires a company we do not look to make immediate changes to the business. However, financial reporting is something that does change after the deal closes. This typically means two changes for a business: 1) monthly reporting is completed in a more timely manner and 2) additional financial reporting is required. Timely Monthly Reporting. Hadley Capital receives monthly financials (income statement and balance sheet) from our portfolio companies within 30 days after month end. Most small businesses are not used to producing monthly financials this quickly. While this can be an adjustment, our portfolio companies eventually see the benefits of timely reporting. It is much easier to manage a business when you have timely data. Additional Financial Reporting. Borrowing Base Certificate. All of our portfolio companies have a revolving line of credit to manage working capital. A line of credit is supported by a borrowing base certificate. A borrowing base lists a company’s eligible accounts receivable and inventory and dictates how much the company can borrow. Many small businesses are not accustomed to providing monthly accounts receivable aging reports and monthly inventory reports. However, the benefits of access to additional capital (via a line of credit) are greater than the administrative burden of creating these reports. Financial Covenant Calculations. Banks and mezzanine lenders use financial covenants to monitor the performance of a borrower. These lenders receive quarterly financial covenants calculations from the borrower. Financial Covenants give the lenders a heads up if the financial standing of the borrower has changed over a given period of time. For example, one common financial covenant is Total Leverage. The Total Leverage covenant measures the Total Debt (senior debt + mezzanine debt) in relation to the trailing twelve months (TTM) of EBITDA. So if the Total Leverage covenant is Total Debt must be less than 4.0x TTM EBITDA, the borrower has to perform this calculation each quarter and send the results to the lender in a covenant compliance certificate. If the Total Leverage is less than 4.0x then the borrower is in compliance with the covenant. However, if Total Leverage goes above 4.0x, the borrower is not in compliance and the lender will want to sit down with the borrower and understand why things have changed. Covenant calculations are not difficult, but most small businesses are not used to completing them so it can take some time getting used to. Individually none of these financial reporting requirements are a big deal, but collectively they can seem like a lot to a small business. However, we have been through the process many times and we work with our portfolio companies to make it a smooth transition. The lenders that work with our portfolio companies typically require our companies to submit a monthly borrowing base certificate and quarterly financial covenant certificates.

We typically buy businesses from owner/managers who want to retire, either immediately or over the next few years. If the owner is the most valuable person in the businesses, which is often the case, our transition risk is higher. This has a negative impact on value. If, on the other hand, the owner/manager is not the most important person, and there are lots of other important people working in the business, then our transition risk is lower. This has a positive impact on value. Here are some questions we seek to answer when evaluating the transition risk associated with a target company: If the owner were absent, is there someone that could run the day-to-day operations of the business? If so, who? And what are that person's strengths and weaknesses? Do all the employees in the company report to the owner or are there other key managers? Did the owner create all the intellectual property in the business or did other key employees play a role? Does the owner make all the important business decisions? How difficult would it be to hire someone from outside the company to replace the owner? Just because an owner/manager who wants to retire is important to a business doesn't mean that Hadley Capital can't buy it, only that we need to first think through how we might most successfully transition it to another manager or team of managers.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/lehman-fee-structure TITLE: How the Lehman Fee Structure Works (Example) BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ How the Lehman Fee Structure Works (Example) Scott Dickes August 15, 2012 - 1 min read We recently got an email from a business broker asking us what type of finders fee structure we typically use. Our standard finder's fee structure is based on the Lehman structure. Since that post has gotten a nice response from the business broker community we thought it might be helpful to walk through a detailed example of how the Lehman structure works. For this example let's assume we have a finder's fee agreement with a Lehman structure with a business broker, and we end up buying a business that they introduced to us for $10 million. This is is how the agreement would pay out: $1 million x 5% = $50,000 $1 million x 4% = $40,000 $1 million x 3% = $30,000 $1 million x 2% = $20,000 $6 million x 1% = $60,000 The total fee for this transaction would be $200,000 (or 2% of the sale price) and it would be payable at closing.This fee structure was created in the early 1970's by Lehman Brothers and it is a very common fee structure for small business acquisitions. We have used this structure with many of our existing portfolio companies. If you are a business broker and you have a business that meets our criteria, please contact us.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/management-buyout TITLE: Insights on Management Buyouts BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Insights on Management Buyouts for Small Businesses Harrison Menaker July 11, 2022 - 4 min read Throughout the life cycle of a business, ownership’s goals change on both an individual and company-wide level. After dedicating themselves to their business for some time, owners often look for an exit strategy that benefits them and ensures their business's future success. If the existing management team wants to stay involved in day-to-day operations and has the desire to pursue additional growth and profitability, a Management Buyout (“MBO”) can act as a powerful transitionary tool for owners, capitalizing off the work they’ve put into the business, while providing an exciting path to ownership for the company’s management team. If you’re a business owner considering a management buyout, this article will help you gauge whether it is the correct choice for your business. If you’re a manager of a business you are hoping to acquire, this article will outline key considerations in a management buyout. Management Buyout Overview In its most basic form, a management buyout involves an owner attempting to sell their company to their management team or a management team approaching an owner to gain majority equity interest in a business. The underlying motivation for both parties involved in the buyout is to generate value. Ownership wants to find a lucrative exit strategy, while management hopes to secure a stake in a valuable business with a platform for growth. In a traditional management buyout, a company's management team acquires the company's equity from the existing owner. There are many forms of a management buyout that we will cover below. Management buyouts require the alignment of several different and sometimes competing interests to reach a common goal. This can turn into a complex process but setting honest expectations and keeping communication transparent can lead to a smooth and efficient process. Benefits to Owners and Management Teams As mentioned earlier, the underlying motivation for parties involved in a buyout is generating value. Value can have different meanings to management and ownership, so we’ve outlined the specific benefits of a management buyout. For Owners: A management buyout creates substantial liquidity through a sale. Owners typically expect to receive significant cash at the closing of a management buyout. Owners can phase themselves out of day-to-day operations as management transitions into a dual management/ownership role. The former owner then has the option to fill an “advisor” role, acting as a resource to management. Existing management already possesses the expertise and dedication to run the business, which allows selling owners to be confident in the continuation of their legacy through the work of a capable successor team. For Management Teams: Managers can become meaningful owners and participate in the upside of their business. The management team can now put in place their desired strategies to pursue additional growth and can benefit from their continued success. As management transitions into ownership, their responsibilities increase, and they fill a larger leadership role in the company. This can be empowering and allow management to further drive the company to reach its long-term vision. Management receives control over both the companies and their own future. The ability to determine the future of their professional career and the feeling of control within a business is an intangible benefit new ownership receives. Management Buyout Options: Finding the Right Fit There are several forms of an MBO: leveraged management buyout, phased management buyouts, management buy-ins, and employee stock ownership plans. Leveraged Management Buyout Most management buyouts are completed using debt financing, also commonly called “leverage” – hence the name “leveraged management buyout.” In a leveraged management buyout, management raises capital in the form of equity and debt financing to acquire the company. The equity may be raised from management’s own savings, friends and family, or third-party equity sources like private equity firms. Debt capital is raised from commercial lenders, and company assets are used as collateral to secure debt financing. Seller notes are also commonly used to finance a portion of the acquisition price. In a leveraged management buyout, it is most common for the management team to acquire a significant majority equity position in the target company. Phased Management Buyouts Alternatively, some management buyouts are done over a longer horizon. Management may receive a small equity position from the existing owner with the right to acquire additional equity ownership over time at a fixed valuation or a valuation tied to relevant business performance metrics. This form of long-term succession ensures the capability of management to eventually fill an ownership role. Additionally, if future ownership is tied to business performance, it may motivate management to work in the business's best interest and increase value for both parties. Long-horizon successions can be useful in certain situations, but they require the time and effort of current ownership to ensure its success. Management Buy-In During a management buy-in, an external management team acquires the business and supplements and can replace or maintain the current team. Management buy-ins are commonly done with the help of a private equity firm. The private equity firm provides the bulk of the capital to complete the acquisition and installs a management team they are familiar with to run the company. Given the risk that new, external management does not have the expertise to run the company as planned, a management buy-in is sometimes considered disadvantageous when compared to a traditional management buyout where the existing team continues to run the company after a sale. Employee Stock Ownership Plans Employee Stock Ownership Plans (“ESOPs”) involves an owner selling their company to its employees. ESOPs are retirement plans that use borrowed money and funds from existing employee’s retirement plans to fund the “purchase” of the business from the owner. ESOPs provide great tax benefits and use share value as an incentive for employees to ensure they work in the company's best interest. However, ESOPs are extremely complex to set up and administer and may be a less appealing choice when compared to a simpler and faster management buyout. Given the wide variety of choices available, it is important for both management and ownership to understand the rationale behind each option. Traditional management buyouts and leveraged buyouts have the advantage of speed and reliability, but there are downsides they can present as well. Since management is the decided purchaser from the onset of the transaction, ownership loses the benefit of marketing to a large buyer pool and the potential for a higher valuation.  For the management team, acquiring the business, you operate from the existing owner can present challenges in negotiating valuation and key transaction terms as well as sourcing the capital required to fund the transaction. Parties Involved in a Management Buyout Looking closer at the individuals involved in a management buyout, there are five identifiable key players: the seller, the buyer, the lender, the source of equity, and the service providers. Seller: The seller is the current owner of the business who is attempting to exit - immediately or over time. The seller may be active in the day-to-day operations or be a passive, inactive owner. Buyer: The buyer is the manager(s) that is currently operating the business and is seeking to replace the current owner either in part or in full. Lender: Debt financing for the purchase of a business can come from several different lending sources. Commercial lenders are the most frequently used source. However, alternatives exist, such as a seller note, which allows a business with limited debt capacity to secure funding for the transaction through the repayment of debt to the seller or owner. Equity: Equity can come from many different sources to help fund an acquisition. Management, private equity firms, and even individual investors can serve as viable sources of equity financing in a management buyout. Service Providers: Service providers include accountants, attorneys, and additional consultants that ensure the legitimacy of records, provide market research, and help form documentation to finalize the buyout. Important Considerations, Common Challenges, & Potential Pitfalls Most difficulties during a management buyout happen due to conflicting expectations or inaccurate information. Having productive conversations between management and ownership to align goals before undergoing a management buyout is a great preventative act. While there are many considerations in a management buyout process, there are a handful of significant issues that often need to be addressed to achieve a successful outcome for both parties: Valuation Due Diligence Transaction Structure Go-Forward Roles The valuation of the target company is often the first consideration that must be addressed between the buyer (management team) and the seller (existing owner). This process can be tricky as valuation is often a zero-sum game. Establishing an agreed-upon valuation can be done with or without the use of third-party advisors like M&A advisors or business valuation firms. Advanced preparation for the due diligence process can save time and effort to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all parties. The target company in a management buyout must be able to articulate both financial and key business information to lenders and other financing sources thoroughly. This due diligence process can be difficult for businesses with poor record-keeping practices, as investors will want assurance of past performance and any additional claims made by ownership. Fortunately, in a management buyout, management’s existing knowledge of the business can lessen the burden of due diligence when compared to selling a company to an outside buyer. The appropriate capital structure (mix of debt and equity) to fund the transaction must also be determined to ensure the viability of the business after the transaction closes. Finding the optimal breakdown of funding helps ensure that the capital structure of the business is sound and provides appropriate operating flexibility and liquidity. Management should be realistic about how much equity and debt they can source when purchasing a business. Bringing in an equity partner may seem unappealing to managers who hope to gain full control of the business, but exposing the company to risk associated with increased debt can also prove to be detrimental. Factoring in the effects of funding on capital structure will ensure the business remains viable after closing the transaction. Go-forward roles of management and former owners are often an area of potential friction in management buyouts. Former owners may stay too involved in the business after closing, which can be frustrating to incoming ownership. In addition, former owners could also remove themselves entirely from daily operations, which could leave incoming owners clueless about important parts of the business operation. Specific details outlining the involvement of both management and former ownership should be created to eliminate any conflict after the transaction. Private Equity and its Role in Management Buyouts Private equity firms can be valuable partners to management teams seeking to complete a management buyout. Private equity firms provide relevant transaction experience, a ready source of capital, relationships with debt sources, and resources and support for management after a transaction closes. However, it is important to research the focus of the private equity firm before incorporating them into the transaction. Creating alignment around expectations, future goals, and business values are critical to a successful partnership. Bluff Manufacturing – Management Buyouts at Hadley Bluff Manufacturing manufactures and sells heavy-duty steel and aluminum dock boards and plates, portable yard ramps, and other warehouse safety equipment to companies throughout North America. Bluff’s longstanding commitment to the highest quality and outstanding customer service has helped to sell its dock solutions products to companies both large and small. How Hadley Helped Clark Smith grew Bluff Manufacturing from a small metal fabrication shop into a leading, branded manufacturer of heavy-duty material handling equipment. Hadley met Clark in 2011 when he was looking for a partner to help him complete a management buyout from an inactive owner. Clark was eager to gain an experienced partner to help him transition leadership of the business and to support his team’s growth strategy. Following the management buyout, Hadley and Clark promoted Andrea Curreri from Vice President to President while Clark continued to serve as a mentor and board member. Andrea moved quickly, implementing numerous growth and improvement plans with Hadley’s support. Bluff added financial systems and staff, invested heavily in new marketing initiatives, introduced numerous new products, recruited additional managers, developed new channel partners, and added stocking warehouses throughout the United States. Bluff’s sales and profitability grew substantially during Hadley’s ownership and under Andrea’s leadership, and in 2016 we sold the business to Wincove Private Holdings, a larger private equity firm. Wincove and Bluff then bought two other companies, Westco and Nordock, and combined these three entities under a new umbrella company named Integrated Warehouse Solutions. In Conclusion Conducting a management buyout can be daunting, but a successful transaction can often meet the needs of all stakeholders and create a unique win/win outcome. Hadley has worked with a number of management teams and owners on successful management buyouts. Are you looking to explore options for selling your business via a management buyout?

This post will cover Mezzanine debt. Specifically, I’m going to talk about: What is Mezzanine Financing? What is Mezzanine Debt? Mezzanine Debt vs. Senior Debt Mezzanine Debt vs. Equity Mezzanine Debt Uses Mezzanine Debt Interest Rates Mezzanine Finance Structure Mezzanine Debt in Small Company Acquisitions Mezzanine Debt Pros and Cons Sources of Mezzanine Debt What is Mezzanine Financing? The word mezzanine is defined as the "partial story or level between two main stories of a building". In this case of a company’s capital structure (those sources of funds used to finance the operations of the business), the two main "finance stories" of a company’s capital structure are senior debt and equity. Mezzanine financing sits between senior debt and equity. What is Mezzanine Debt? Mezzanine debt then is the middle level or "mezzanine" between senior debt and equity. At the middle level, mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior debt but in a senior position to equity. As such, it is priced between senior debt (as the lowest cost financing) and equity (as the highest). Mezzanine debt has both debt-like features and equity-like features. The debt-like features include a principal amount that will be repaid as well as interest to be paid current or deferred through a payment-in-kind structure. The equity-like features allow the provider of the mezzanine debt to participate in the upside of the business, like equity owners, typically through equity warrants. Mezzanine Debt vs. Senior Debt Mezzanine debt is more expensive than senior debt because 1) it is subordinate to senior debt (meaning in a liquidation the senior debt lender will be paid in full before the mezzanine lenders sees a dollar) and 2) it typically does not require any principal payment until the end of the term loan. This structure obviously creates more risk for the mezzanine lenders and as a result they charge higher interest rates. Mezzanine Debt vs. Equity Mezzanine debt is more expensive than senior debt but is less expensive than equity. Mezzanine debt is less dilutive than raising new equity and allows existing owners to maintain control. Mezzanine Debt Uses The unique features of mezzanine debt - mainly payment flexibility and relative risk appetite - make it a nice tool to fund capital requirements in a growing business or in the case of an acquisition. Typical uses of mezzanine debt include: Recapitalizations Leveraged buyouts Management buyouts Growth capital Acquisitions Shareholder buyouts Refinancings Balance sheet restructuring However, given the high cost of mezzanine debt, it is important that a borrower ensures it does not have a cheaper source of financing available, is confident in the ability to service the mezzanine debt, and fully understands the terms of the mezzanine loan. Mezzanine Debt Interest Rates **Mezzanine loans are typically priced anywhere between 15–20%.**There are three main components of mezzanine debt: 1) current interest 2) payment-in-kind (or “PIK”) interest and 3) equity warrants. As mentioned, mezzanine loans are typically interest only with the principal due at the end of a five or seven year term. Current interest payments are typically due monthly or quarterly. For example, a $3 million 15% current pay interest mezzanine loan with a 5 year term would look something like this: Mezzanine Finance Structure In some cases mezzanine lenders will PIK (Payment-in-Kind) a portion of the interest payment and add it to the principal amount of the loan. In this case, there will be two buckets of interest: current cash interest and PIK interest. Here is what it would look like if a mezzanine lender offered a $3 million loan with 14% current cash interest and 2% PIK interest: Mezzanine debt can also frequently include equity warrants, which are very similar to equity options. Warrants give lenders equity upside when the borrower performs well. Warrants typically represent 1–5% of the fully diluted ownership of the company. Mezzanine Debt in Small Company Acquisitions Due to the high-interest rates associated with mezzanine debt, we work with management to pay it off sooner rather than later or to refinance the mezzanine debt with lower-cost senior debt. If a company is performing well and has plenty of cash, we will use some cash to pay down the mezzanine debt subject to certain prepayment penalties that may apply. Hadley has completed more than 30 acquisitions of small companies during our history. Many of these acquisitions utilized an appropriate amount of mezzanine debt to fully fund the acquisition. We typically use 1x–1.5x EBITDA (or cash flow) of mezzanine debt in an acquisition. So if we buy a company for 5x EBITDA, a typical capital structure might be 2x senior debt, 1x mezzanine debt and 2x equity. Our experience shows that 3x total debt (2x EBITDA of senior debt + 1x EBITDA of mezzanine debt) is typically an appropriate amount of debt in a small company acquisition. Hadley typically sources mezzanine debt from mezzanine debt funds where we have long-standing relationships with the principals of the mezzanine debt funds. See below for more information on sources of mezzanine debt. Mezzanine Debt Pros and Cons As mentioned previously, mezzanine debt can be a useful tool in the right circumstances. However, it is important that a small business borrower fully understand the implications of this type of financing: Pros: Less costly than equity More patient capital (no loan amortization) Ability to retain majority control More flexibility than senior debt Alternative capital source with higher risk appetite Cons: More costly than senior debt May create modest equity dilution through equity warrants Borrower will need to adhere to financial covenants Prepayment penalties may apply Sources of Mezzanine Debt Mezzanine debt is primarily available through non-bank lenders such as mezzanine debt funds. Some sophisticated senior bank lenders may also provide mezzanine debt alongside traditional senior debt. The U.S. Small Business Administration sponsors a program designed to provide capital to small businesses through Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs): “An SBIC is a privately owned company that’s licensed and regulated by the SBA. SBICs invest in small businesses in the form of debt and equity. The SBA doesn’t invest directly into small businesses, but it does provide funding to qualified SBICs with expertise in certain sectors or industries. Those SBICs then use their private funds, along with SBA-guaranteed funding, to invest in small businesses.” Many mezzanine debt funds are formed as SBICs with a specific focus on providing mezzanine loans to small businesses. A list of SBICs and an overview of the SBIC program is available on the SBA’s website. Mezzanine debt can be an important part of financing a small company acquisition, management buyout or growth plan - as the story or level between traditional senior debt and equity.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/my-business-is-worth-less-than-its-asset-value TITLE: Asset-Based Valuations: Benefits and Pitfalls BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Asset-Based Valuations: Benefits and Pitfalls Paul Wormley October 20, 2021 - 2 min read Asset-Based valuations are a form of business valuation that is centered on the value of a company’s assets. Asset-Based valuations are most commonly calculated using Net Book Value. Net Book Value = Total Assets - Total Liabilities There are a number of issues related to Asset-Based valuations that will be covered in this post: Asset Valuation Approaches Asset-Based Valuation Example Asset-Based Valuation Versus Enterprise Value and Equity Value Businesses Worth More Than Asset Value Businesses Worth Less Than Asset Value Asset Valuation Approaches Since the core of an asset-based valuation is determining the underlying value of the assets (subtracted from liabilities) it is important to determine how the assets will be valued in the first place. There are multiple ways to value assets: GAAP or balance sheet value is the balance of the assets as displayed on a company’s balance sheet including fixed assets net of depreciation. This is the most common approach to calculating net book value but may understate value. Replacement value is what it would cost to replace the assets in hand and often requires a formal appraisal in order to determine. Replacement value is often the highest value assigned to assets. Fair market value (FMV) of assets is often a better proxy for true asset value because FMV generally reflects the earning potential of the assets. Orderly liquidation value may be a more appropriate FMV if a business is not producing positive earnings. Asset-Based Valuation Example Let’s look at an example Net Book Value calculation using our hypothetical business - Bob’s Tees R Us: Using the most recent balance sheet from Bob’s Tees R Us we calculate the Net Book Value as Total Assets minus Total Liabilities. The GAAP balance sheet produces a Net Book Value of $380. This is the lowest of the three calculations of net book value because Bob has aggressively depreciated his fixed assets over the last three years, lowering the Total Asset amount by $175. Using the replacement value of assets, the Net Book Value is $555. This is because the replacement costs of Bob’s fixed assets are assumed to be the same as their purchase price. This increases the Total Asset amount by $175. Using the fair market value of assets, the Net Book Value is $480. This is between the GAAP and replacement netbook values because the fair market value is $100 higher than the GAAP value but $75 lower than the replacement value. Asset-Based Valuation vs Enterprise Value and Equity Value As shown above, asset-based valuations can be calculated simply by knowing the assets and liabilities of a company. It does not rely on placing a value on a company’s underlying equity. While this simplicity makes asset-based valuations useful, it may also result in an understatement of the actual market value (or ‘enterprise value’) of a business. Enterprise value and equity value are related in that equity value is a part of enterprise value. Enterprise value is equivalent to what a third party would pay for all of the stock and assets of a firm. Equity value is the portion of enterprise value that is attributable to its equity investors. It is calculated by taking a company’s enterprise value and subtracting the value of any debt owed by the company and then adding the value of any excess cash owned by it. More detail on enterprise versus equity value is available in this blog post. Enterprise value is typically derived from market comparable valuations, discounted cash flow analysis, and/or cash flow multiples. We’ve written in more detail about these valuation techniques. As a result, these valuation techniques tend to be more accurate reflections of the value of a business. The downside is they are more complicated to calculate. Businesses Worth More Than Asset Value In nearly every case, a successful company with good cash flows will have an enterprise value that exceeds its asset value. One reason this is the case is that, as described above, book value tends to understate market value because many businesses have significant intangible assets (brand name, reputation, service level, etc.) that don’t show up on the balance sheet, and thus, are not included in a calculation of book value. Further, these same intangible assets, in combination with other assets, are often used to create significant value for a customer that, in turn, creates repeatable profits and cash flow for the company. Businesses Worth Less Than Asset Value However, it’s not always the case that a company’s enterprise value will exceed its asset value. Recently, we’ve come across several companies for sale with substantial fixed assets – generally in the form of manufacturing equipment. A large asset base is normally positive in the sale of a small business because it provides a buyer with the collateral necessary to obtain financing from a bank. In the particular cases we were evaluating, each company’s large fixed asset base actually prevented a transaction from occurring. Why? Because these businesses did not generate enough free cash flow to support an enterprise value/purchase price equal to or in excess of the replacement value of assets. That is, using Enterprise Valuation techniques described above, the business was worth less than the replacement value of assets. The owners of these companies had a hard time reconciling that their business was worth less than the assets in place. It comes down to the old saying, cash is king…free cash flow in this case. Most buyers value a company on its ability to produce free cash flow or EBITDA. Click here for a more detailed overview of EBITDA. If a company’s free cash flow is low relative to a large asset base, it may be the case that the enterprise value is lower than the net asset value. In this situation, a business owner has two primary options: Increase the return on assets: use the existing assets in place to generate higher profits and free cash flow. Sell the assets, not the business: determine if an orderly liquidation of the assets would result in more proceeds than selling the business outright. Asset-Based valuations are one approach to business valuation. In most cases, asset-based valuations are likely to understate the market value of the enterprise value of a business. However, there are circumstances where asset-based valuations are useful including for businesses that are not making positive profits or where calculating enterprise valuations would be complex, expensive, or impractical.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/purchase-price-allocation TITLE: Purchase Price Allocation in Small Company Acquisitions BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Purchase Price Allocation in Small Company Acquisitions Ryan Hanley February 07, 2022 - 3 min read In the sale of a small company, the allocation of purchase price for tax purposes creates important considerations for sellers and it is important for sellers to have a basic understanding of how it works. Most small businesses in the U.S. are structured as S Corporations. Sellers of S Corporations are generally neutral to selling stock versus selling assets whereas buyers generally prefer acquiring assets. This topic is covered in greater detail in my colleague’s post: Asset Sale v. Stock Sale. For this reason, the majority of small company transactions are structured as asset acquisitions. An important consideration in a transaction structured as an asset sale is the purchase price allocation because it determines the sellers’ tax liability and the buyers’ tax basis in the acquired assets. Purchase Price Allocation Purchase price allocation is the process of assigning the purchase price of a business to the assets sold for the purposes of determining taxes owed by the seller and reporting the sale to the IRS. Who is Responsible for Purchase Price Allocation? The Internal Revenue Code requires that both buyers and sellers submit a purchase price allocation on form 8594. A common misconception is that buyers and sellers must submit consistent purchase price allocations. However, if a buyer and seller submit contradicting purchase price allocations, the IRS may challenge one or both purchase price allocations. Therefore, it is best for buyers and sellers to agree on a purchase price allocation prior to closing. Most asset purchase agreements contain language requiring agreement on purchase price allocation. What is the Fair Value of an Asset? IRS Form 8594 defines seven asset classes to which the entire purchase price must be allocated. To comply with GAAP, buyers must allocate purchase price to assets based on their “fair value”. Fair Value is defined as “The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” For the lower and more liquid asset classes such as cash, securities, and accounts receivable, determining a fair value is straightforward as the values on sellers’ balance sheets usually reflect the assets’ fair values. Less liquid hard assets such as property, plant, and equipment, often have a fair value different than the carrying value on sellers’ balance sheets. As such, buyers and sellers usually have an appraisal performed to determine the fair value of hard assets. I’ll cover this topic in greater detail in the depreciation recapture section of the post. The seven asset classes along with buyers’ and sellers’ typical allocation preferences are outlined briefly below. How do You Allocate Purchase Price in an Asset Sale? Purchase price allocation to the various asset classes above can have a major impact on the value received by both buyers and sellers in an acquisition. Sellers’ and buyers’ purchase price allocation preferences are typically at odds with each other. That is, purchase price allocation, for the most part, is a zero-sum game, any tax benefit gained by a seller will be lost by a buyer and vice versa. Buyers prefer to allocate purchase price towards assets that can be deducted quickly against their New Company’s income. For example, buyers prefer fixed asset values to be as high as possible as they can depreciate the fixed assets over 5 or 7 years, two to three times faster than they would be able to amortize the alternative, goodwill. Sellers prefer to allocate purchase price towards asset classes that will be subject to capital gains tax treatment. Fortunately, under the required residual method asset classification is straightforward. Residual Method The residual method entails buyers and sellers placing a fair value on the assets being acquired and then allocating the purchase price to their respective asset class, with any remaining value allocated to goodwill. The residual method requires that purchase price be allocated in the following manner: Reduce the purchase price by the amount of Class I assets (cash and equivalents) transferred from seller to buyer. Allocate the remaining purchase price to Class II assets (Securities), then to Class III (Accounts Receivable), IV (Inventory), V (Fixed Assets), and VI (Intangibles) assets in that order. Within each class, allocate the remaining purchase price to the class assets in proportion to their fair market values on the purchase date. Allocate any remaining purchase price to Class VII assets (Goodwill). The amount allocated to an asset, other than a Class VII asset, cannot exceed its fair market value on the purchase date. If an asset in one of the classifications described above can be included in more than one class, it should be allocated to the lower numbered class (for example, if an asset could be included in Class III or IV, choose Class III). Purchase Price Allocation Example Let’s walk through an example using our hypothetical business, Bob’s Tees R Us. Bob’s Tees R Us is structured as a S Corporation and is being acquired by Hadley in a cash-free debt-free transaction. The only liability being acquired by Hadley is Bob’s accounts payable. All other liabilities, whether known or unknown, are being retained by Bob. Bob’s Tees R Us has the following balance sheet: Bob has agreed to sell Bob’s Tees R Us to Hadley for $5.0 million: $4.0 million in cash plus a seller note of $1 million. Hadley and Bob hire a professional appraiser that appraises Bob’s fixed assets at a fair value of $750,000. Bob is in the highest marginal tax bracket. Bob and Hadley agree to the below purchase price allocation which results in Bob’s tax position being as follows: Bob’s total tax due from the sale is $925,000. Outside of the favorably taxed goodwill, Bob pays the highest marginal rate on his fixed assets because the sale price exceeds his tax basis in the fixed assets. This outcome is due to a concept known as “depreciation recapture”. Depreciation Recapture Depreciation recapture is the difference between the sale price and the sellers’ tax basis in fixed assets. Depreciation recapture can occur in the sale of a business or if a company, in ordinary course, sells a depreciated fixed asset. How is Depreciation Recapture Calculated? Depreciation recapture in a purchase price allocation is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the sellers’ fixed assets and the carrying value of the sellers’ fixed assets. Sellers’ opinions on the “value” of their fixed assets often span a wide range, some may consider the book value and others may consider the used equipment market value or even the liquidation value. A professional appraisal should be performed to determine the true fair value of fixed assets for a purchase price allocation. Sellers with large amounts of fixed assets that have been significantly depreciated, particularly those subject to accelerated depreciation, may be startled by the tax liability resulting from depreciation recapture. Let’s walk through an example to illustrate. Depreciation Recapture Example Bob’s brother, Tom, owns Tom’s Clubs R Us. Tom’s Clubs R Us has fixed assets that were purchased for $5 million. Based on the advice of his accountant, Tom used accelerated depreciation, particularly Section 179 deductions, to depreciate his fixed assets in order to lower his historical profits and related taxes. Tom’s fixed assets have a tax basis of $500,000. Tom has not read this post, so he doesn’t understand how purchase price allocation works. Tom incorrectly assumes that only $500,000 should be allocated to fixed assets in a purchase price allocation because that is his carrying value for tax. As such, Tom expects that there will be no taxable gain on his fixed assets in a sale, with the balance of any gain being attributable to goodwill and taxed at capital gains rates. Tom was unaware that the fair value of his fixed assets, not his tax basis, is used in purchase price allocation. The Buyer of Tom’s Clubs R Us hires a professional appraiser that determines that the fair value of Tom’s fixed assets is $4.5 million. The $4 million difference between $4.5 million and $500,000 is subject to depreciation recapture which is taxed as ordinary income. Under the current tax code, Tom’s long term capital gains are taxed at 20% and his ordinary income is taxed at 37%. In Tom’s case the “extra” 17% results in $680,000 of “additional tax” in the sale. Tom complains to the Buyer that it’s unfair that he is stuck with the additional $680,000 of tax. The Buyer explains to Tom that his depreciation recapture tax bill is so large because he utilized accelerated depreciation to reduce his income taxes over the past several years. That is, Tom’s depreciation recapture is only a make-whole for the IRS. Tom is not really out-of-pocket an additional $680,000 because he received the same tax benefit in prior tax years. The Value of Understanding Purchase Price Allocation Purchase price allocation has major tax implications for sellers, which makes it important for sellers to have a basic understanding of how it works. This post provides the basic mechanics of purchase price allocation, but it is prudent for sellers to consult with tax accountants, M&A advisors, and attorneys when completing a purchase price allocation. Don’t end up like Tom with a surprise tax bill of $680,000 owed to Uncle Sam. Thinking of selling your business? Contact Hadley Capital today to get a confidential valuation report.

A seller note, also commonly known as seller paper and seller debt, is a form of financing used in small company sale transactions whereby a seller agrees to receive a portion of the acquisition proceeds in a series of debt payments. A seller note is commonly used to bridge a gap between the amount a seller is seeking in a sale transaction and the amount a buyer is willing or able to pay. Seller notes are also often used to fund buy/sell agreements between two partners in a business and when a seller elects to sell his or her company to their management team. In this blog, we will describe the following scenarios: Where a Seller Note is Used How a Seller Note Works Different Types of Principal and Interest Payments on Seller Notes Benefits and Risks to the Seller Where a Seller Note is Used Bridge the Gap Seller notes are a tool to bridge a gap between total financing available to a buyer and the purchase price and/or to bridge a value gap between buyer and seller In the first instance , a seller note can bridge a gap between the amount of capital a buyer can access and the total purchase price. If the buyer can only secure a bank loan that is 70% of the acquisition price and equity that is 20%, there may be a seller note issued that holds the remaining 10% of the price. In the second, if a buyer values a business at $9 million and the seller is seeking $10 million, a seller can help bridge the $1 million gap by issuing a seller note. There are a few options if the purchase price exceeds the capital available to a buyer. The buyer can seek a larger bank loan or use more equity, the buyer and seller could agree on an earnout, and/or the seller could issue a seller note. First, the buyer could secure a larger bank loan to cover the gap with leverage. However, a bank may be hesitant to increase their loan size if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is above the bank's comfort level. A Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (“FCCR”) is calculated by dividing the target companies EBITDA less CAPEX and cash taxes by the interest and principal on the bank’s loan. In small company transactions, most banks require a FCCR of 1.2 to 1.25. That is, there needs to be enough EBITDA (or free cash) to pay a little over 1x the annual interest and principal payments on the loan. The bank will enforce this requirement (also commonly called a covenant) to reduce the risk of the loan. As a result, if there is a gap between the buyer’s available financing and the purchase price, a bank may not lend additional bank debt because it will bring the FCCR below the required level. Another option for the buyer to bridge the financing gap is to use more equity. However, equity is an expensive form of financing as it is the riskiest form of capital and a buyer may not have enough capital to fund a larger portion of the purchase price. The buyer and seller could also bridge the financing gap via an earnout . An earnout is similar to a seller note, in that the seller agrees to receive a portion of the purchase price over time. Most Earn-Outs are contingent on future performance – often based on future revenue, gross profit or EBITDA performance. In exchange for accepting this risk, Earn-Outs often have a larger total value than seller notes. The value of the Earn-Out is driven solely on the future performance of the business. If the business does not perform, the seller may not be paid. A seller note is a nice middle ground for the buyer and seller by  bridging the financing gap and providing benefits to both parties . A seller note may be more desirable for the seller than an Earn-Out because the buyer receives interest and principal payments, the seller note is senior to the equity, and most Earn-Outs are tied to future performance. Rather, the seller note becomes an obligation of the business and must be repaid according to its terms (more on this below). Example of a Seller Note: Bridging a Valuation Gap A seller note can be an effective way to bridge a gap between the price a buyer is willing to pay and the price a seller is willing to accept. If a buyer and seller are close, but not together, the seller note can be one way to make the transaction work for both parties. The buyer can close the transaction without raising additional outside capital by receiving a seller note from the seller. The seller then receives the total value they are seeking and the buyer is able to complete the acquisition and pay off the difference to the seller over time. Fund a Buy-Sell Agreement Seller notes are also often used to fund Buy-Sell Agreements between two partners. A Buy-Sell agreement is a contract that states how a company’s shares will be valued, and subsequently purchased, when one partner decides to leave the partnership, dies, or is fired. If the remaining partner lacks the cash/equity to purchase the departing partners’ shares, the departing partner may issue a seller note to the remaining partner to “fund” the purchase. Sell the Business to the Management Team Similarly, when a business owner seeks a sale of his or her business to their management team, a seller note is often used to fund a portion or all of the purchase price. In many cases, the management team will not have the equity capital required to fund the purchase price so the seller will issue a seller note to the management team. This allows the business owner to exit at the time that they want and receive the purchase price over time as the seller note is paid back. How a Seller Note Works Seller notes are a form of debt financing that is structured as an interest-bearing loan. Seller notes are typically subordinated to any bank loans (commonly called “Senior Debt”) used to finance a transaction. If there is no Senior Debt, the seller note will not be subordinated. Subordination is an important topic to understand in small company transactions. In a typical acquisition including Senior Debt, seller notes, and equity, the Senior Debt has the highest priority for payment, followed by seller notes and then equity. As a result, there is more risk to a seller note than Senior Debt. To offset this risk, seller notes often pay a higher rate than Senior Debt. In relation to the current market, most Senior Debt is repaid on a straight line basis over five years at a rate of 4% - 5%.  A typical seller note will mature over a similar period and carry an interest rate of 6-10%. Further, the interest on a seller note may or may not be paid on a current basis through the maturity date. Instead, the interest may be deferred or accrued until the maturity date. Deferred interest payments may be necessary in order to reduce the annual cash interest expense. This way the seller note does not affect the bank’s required FCCR or other covenants. Deferred interest payments also improve the cash flow in the business– ensuring it has adequate cash flow to cover working capital requirements, other operating needs, and/or investment opportunities. Different Types of Principal and Interest Payments on Seller Notes Bullet (PIK) A bullet note describes a loan that pays all the principal at the maturity date. Bullet loans can have deferred interest payments or recurring interest payments. Deferred interest payments are often called Payment in Kind, (“PIK”) interest. PIK interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the seller note. The interest is then compounding over time. For example, if the principal balance of the seller note is $10,000 with an annual PIK interest of 5%, the first-year interest expense is $500. The second year would be $525 because the prior year's interest payment is added to the principal. The third year interest would be $551.3 and so forth. Each year, the PIK interest is added to the principal amount and is due at the maturity date. Bullet (No PIK) A bullet note can also include current interest payments rather than PIK interest payments. The original principal is still paid at maturity date, but the interest payments are made annually and do not compound. Using the same example above - a $10,000 seller note with 5% interest - the annual cash interest expense would be $500 each year. In the figure below, the interest is paid annually (or current) to the holder of the seller note. Amortization (Straight Line) The most common method of repaying a bank loan is straight-line principal amortization over the term of the note with regular cash interest. In simple terms, paying a portion of the principal and interest at every installment date. Each principal payment will be the same amount and the interest payment will decline over the life of the loan. Most bank loans with straight line amortization do not include deferred or PIK interest payments. A straight line amortization note contrasts with a mortgage-style note where each payment amount is the same and the portion of principal paid increases over the life of the loan while the interest portion decreases. Most commercial loans, including seller notes, rarely use this method of repayment. Seller notes are most commonly structured as five-year bullet notes with current (no PIK) interest. Benefits and Risks to the Seller There are many benefits to a seller of utilizing a seller note in small company transactions: Benefits to the Seller: Typically, a seller note allows for more flexibility in the acquisition and increases the probability of closing the transaction at a value acceptable to the seller. Receiving interest over the life of the loan will increase the total value received, and the interest is often much higher than a seller can receive from cash sitting in a bank account. Cash can only earn at most 1%, if it sits in a bank, while a note can earn 6-10%. The seller knows the business well and can have confidence they will be repaid. Where there are benefits to the seller, there are also risks. Risks to the Seller: Most seller notes are unsecured. This means if the business were to fail, and the seller note defaults, there may not be any collateral to cover the seller note. The future performance of the business is unknown and, like any lender, this presents a risk that the seller note may not be repaid. Seller notes are subordinated to Senior Debt. If the business is not producing enough free cash to cover all of its obligations, including the seller note, the seller note may be impaired. Conclusion A seller note can be a great option to bridge a valuation or financing gap in a small company acquisition, to “fund” a buy/sell agreement, or to “fund” the sale of a business to a management team. Seller notes benefit both parties and can be structured to meet the unique requirements of the transaction. However, it’s important to understand the structure as well as the benefits and risks of seller notes.

BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Should Your Company Do An ESOP or Sell? Paul Wormley April 04, 2012 - 2 min read Over the years we have evaluated a number of small company acquisitions where the target company was deciding between doing an ESOP or selling the business to a financial sponsor like Hadley Capital. ESOP promoters are quick to point out the significant economic benefits to ESOPs, mostly related to preferential tax treatment of ESOP contributions and distributions. However, there are a number of problems with ESOPs that are not immediately transparent to small businesses. We have developed a list of problems with ESOPs based, in some cases, on first hand accounts of companies that we were evaluating.  Here are a few: 1. _ESOPs are complex and expensive _& ESOP is an acronym for Employee Stock Ownership Plan. ESOPs are qualified, defined contribution, employee benefit plans that are regulated by the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974 (better known as ERISA) and, thus, subject to byzantine rules. The ESOP Association itself suggests that "plan sponsors consider the following": & Seek professional help in designing the ESOP documents including the Plan Document. & Strictly adhere to fiduciary structure and document all governance steps and decisions. & Continually review the investment of employer stock and develop a list of factors to be reviewed. Follow and update that list as appropriate. & Communicate accurately when discussing employer stock with employees and make sure they are clearly advised of the risks inherent with an employer stock investment. & Consider engaging in an independent trustee to serve participant interests, or a qualified outside firm for plan administration and record keeping. Request indemnification from outsiders for any errors they may make and obtain evidence of their errors and omissions insurance policy. & Purchase adequate Fiduciary Liability Insurance. Sound simple enough? It's not. That's why promoters of ESOPs are paid handsome fees to establish ESOPs and to manage ERISA compliance on a going forward basis. 2. ESOPs have repurchase obligations & Employees can require ESOPs to repurchase their stock when they leave the company. These repurchase obligations must be completed at the company's current ESOP valuation, may put pressure on the company's cash flow, and are out of control of company management. This can limit a company's operating flexibility and balance sheet capacity & rather than investing in attractive growth opportunities a company may be required to maintain balance sheet capacity to fund repurchase obligations. 3. ESOPs can fail and create legal exposure for trustees & Many ESOPs are formed so small business owners can realize cash proceeds from an ESOP "sale". The tax advantages of ESOPs (tax deductibility of principal payments on debt) often result in ESOP "sales" that utilize a substantial amount of deb. Debt can restrict operating flexibility and, in conjunction with a recession or loss of a major customer, can lead to the failure of a company. In this outcome, the trustees of the ESOP (often the business owner that set up the ESOP) can face substantial legal exposure from members of the ESOP. 4. ESOPs are difficult to unwind & The unique structure of ESOPs make it incredibly complex to unwind or sell an ESOP company and/or to raise outside capital for an ESOP company.** ** Unlike selling a closely-held small company, selling an ESOP company can be like selling a quasi-public company. ESOP participants have broad voting and information rights and trustees of an ESOP are required to "maximize shareholder value" & a difficult concept to prove in the sale of small business.  If a single ESOP participant feels like any of the above requirements are violated, even a well conceived transaction can be derailed or squashed. A more detailed outline of these problems is available here. http://www.faegrebd.com/2646 5. _Raising equity capital for an ESOP company can also be very problematic & _ESOP companies must be valued on a regular basis in order to establish a value of the ESOP stock.  These valuations establish a baseline that must be considered when evaluating an equity capital raise. If the valuation is too high (from the perspective of capital sources), it will be difficult to raise outside capital. If the valuation is too low, the ESOP trustees may face disgruntled ESOP shareholders, who face dilution from the new equity capital, opening up the trustees for risks described in #3 above.** ** ESOPs can be a nice exit strategy for some small business owners but they are not perfect for every situation. Small business owners should complete their own due diligence prior to entering into an ESOP arrangement & including talking to successful and unsuccessful ESOP companies. We'd also be willing to share our own experiences with ESOP companies and discuss other ways of addressing the exit goals of a small business owner.

BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ What are Indemnification Baskets and Caps in M&A? Paul Wormley October 21, 2021 - 3 min read Baskets and caps establish limits on the amount a buyer can claim against a seller for certain claims of indemnification. An indemnification ‘cap' limits the overall liability of the seller to some dollar amount and an indemnification ‘basket' establishes a threshold under which the buyer cannot make a claim against the seller. In this blog post, we are going to answer the following questions regarding indemnification in a small business acquisition: What are indemnification caps and how do they work? What are representations and warranties and how do they relate to indemnification? What are indemnification baskets and what types are common? What are Indemnification Caps and How Do They Work? In the legal documents for a small business acquisition, a seller will make certain representations regarding the business.  You can read more about The representations made by a seller are relied upon by the buyer and provide the buyer confidence in what they are buying. A simple example would be that a seller represents that they own the assets they are selling to the buyer. Indemnification baskets and caps are ways for sellers to establish limits on the amount a buyer can claim against representations made by a seller to a buyer. An indemnification ‘basket' establishes a threshold under which dollar amount the buyer cannot make a claim against the seller, and an indemnification ‘cap' limits the overall liability of the seller to a maximum dollar amount. Baskets and caps are just one part of the definitive legal agreements that formally document a transaction, but they're useful to understand. What are Representations and Warranties and How Do They Relate to Indemnification? Baskets and caps are a mechanism for buyers and sellers to establish dollar thresholds related to the representations and warranties made by a seller about the business. The relationship between representations and warranties and indemnification baskets and caps can be confusing. The paragraphs below provide a high-level summary of the relationships as well as a simple example. Representations and Warranties: In the legal documents for a small business acquisition, a seller will make certain representations and warranties regarding the business. For instance, the seller might represent that the business's inventory is of merchantable and usable condition. If it turns out that some of the inventory is obsolete, the buyer might then have a claim against the seller. Other representations concern the quality of the company’s financial statements, its compliance with laws, the conditions of its assets, its compliance with environmental and employment rules and regulations, etc. The buyer and seller will then negotiate the ‘caps’ to these representations; that is, the maximum amount of money the buyer can recoup from the seller if it turns out that these representations are not accurate. Indemnification Caps: Typically, small market transactions have caps equal to 50% of the purchase price. However, such a cap will typically not apply to breaches of the seller’s representations under the purchase agreement, any losses due to fraud, or losses arising from certain ‘fundamental’ representations and warranties that are core the transaction, such as these: Organization and Good Standing: Seller is a company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing and has the full power and authority to own its property and carry on its business. Power, Ownership, Authorization and Validity: Seller and its owners have the right, power, legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform all of their obligations under this Agreement. Title and Condition of Purchased Assets: Seller owns, free and clear of all liens, all of Seller’s real, personal, tangible, intangible, and other properties, rights and other assets of any kind. Intellectual Property: Seller owns all of the intellectual property used by Seller free and clear of any liens. What are Indemnification Baskets and What Types are Common? Indemnification Baskets: Many small market transactions also include a ‘basket’ of some kind. A basket establishes a threshold under which the buyer cannot make a claim against the seller. In small market transactions, the basket amount is usually in the range of $25,000-$50,000, and is often determined as a percentage of the purchase price (around 0.5%). There are two primary types of baskets. A ‘true basket’ (also sometimes called a ‘deductible basket’) means the seller cannot make a claim for indemnification until the total amount of losses exceeds the basket, and then only for the amount of loss in excess of the basket. A ‘tipping basket’ (which is sometimes also referred to as a ‘threshold basket’) is a basket where if the losses equal or exceed the basket amount, the buyer will be entitled to full recover all of his or her losses, from the ‘first dollar.’ Thus, a ‘true basket’ is better for the seller and a ‘tipping basket’ is better for a buyer. Example: Consider the case of a transaction with a purchase price of $5 million. A typical basket would be 0.5% of the purchase price of $25,000 and a typical cap would be $2.5 million or 50% of the purchase price. Tipping basket vs. True basket: With a tipping basket of $25,000, if there were claims totaling $20,000, the buyer could not make a claim against the seller because the $25,000 threshold had not yet been reached. But if the claims totaled $30,000 the buyer could make a claim from the first dollar, that is for the entire $30,000. With a true basket of $25,000, if there were claims totaling $20,000, the buyer could also not make a claim against the seller because the $25,000 threshold had not yet been reached. But if the claims totaled $30,000 the buyer could make a claim for the amount above the deductible of $25,000, or a claim for $5,000. Indemnification caps: Continuing with our example, the seller of the business made a fundamental representation to the buyer that the seller owns all of the Seller’s assets free and clear of all liens. After closing, a lien (or debt) is discovered by the buyer in the amount of $4 million. In this case, the indemnification cap of $2.5 million does not apply because the seller breached a fundamental representation: Title and Condition of Purchased Assets: Seller owns, free and clear of all liens, all of seller’s real, personal, tangible, intangible, and other properties, rights, and other assets of any kind. In this case, the buyer can recover the entire $4 million from the seller due to the seller. Alternatively, assume after closing, that the buyer determines that $3 million of the seller’s inventory is obsolete. In this case, the buyer can pursue an indemnification claim up to the indemnification cap of $2.5 million and subject to the type of basket. One Part of the Legal Agreements Baskets and caps are useful to understand but they are just one part of the definitive legal agreements that formally document a transaction. It is these documents in totality, versus just one part, that constitutes the total risk-sharing of the transaction. That’s why it’s very important to have an experienced M&A attorney working on your transaction who can help negotiate these terms in a way that is fair to all parties and consistent with other similarly sized transactions.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/selling-a-small-business/when-should-i-tell-my-employees TITLE: The Guide to Exit Strategy for Small Business Owners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ The Guide to Exit Strategy for Small Business Owners Sean Fegan July 27, 2021 - 4 min read Following the recent adversity felt by small businesses across the country, we are hearing from a lot of business owners regarding the future of their companies. Developing an appropriate “exit strategy” is a critical element of owning any small business, regardless of when you intend on moving on. Yet, this is not something small business owners readily revisit. We understand the emotional connection that many small company owners have with their businesses, and the idea of stepping away isn’t an easy thought to process or plan. Excluding the emotional drainage of COVID-19, there are several reasons why business owners might be ready to sell: health problems, no more passion for the business, worn down by the day-to-day responsibilities, new interests outside the business, lack of a transition plan, a spouse says it’s time, a need to diversify more, and partnership differences, among others. In addition to downplaying the negative connotation associated with an “exit”, this blog  will address the following: What is an Exit Strategy? Why Have an Exit Strategy? Selling Your Business Other Exit Strategies Tips on Writing an Exit Strategy What is an Exit Strategy? An exit strategy addresses your eventual departure from your company and the means by which it is accomplished. In light of other objectives such as retirement, spending time with family, looking for a change of pace, etc., an effective exit strategy also helps maximize your monetary goals. An appropriate exit strategy is dynamic, reflecting the current situation of the business and adapting as necessary. An exit should not be viewed as potential neglect of your company, rather in a positive light: creating a sense of security for you, your business, and your team as you gradually transition away. Its goal is to help facilitate this transition while creating a sense of direction for the future of the business. Why Have an Exit Strategy Having a strategy in place is beneficial in multiple ways: Enhances Future Company Worth – A well-thought-out exit strategy addresses many of the risks associated with the transition of a small company from one owner to the next, increasing the company’s value. Creates Smooth Transition – An exit strategy allows your employees and management team to prepare for a new future, reducing the risk of any unexpected hurdles. Offers a Safety Net – As previously mentioned, an exit strategy is necessary regardless of when you plan on exiting the business. An active exit strategy also protects the business from unforeseen circumstances, such as incapacitation or an untimely death. Helps Reduce Anxiety – It is normal to feel stressed when envisioning your company without you in it. Knowing there is a plan in place following your departure can help mitigate the potential burden. There are several pathways to support an exit strategy, including selling the business, creating an ESOP, merging with another company, going public, and although not ideal, liquidating it all together. Selling Your Business There are many reasons why a business owner might be hesitant about selling their business: Emotional Attachment – As previously mentioned, we understand the emotional ties an owner has with their company, which can delay the decision. Unknown Territory – Selling your business is a big step and approaching the process can lead to confusion about the process and frustration about how to proceed. Important Decisions – You have worked hard to get your company where it is today, and the thought of handing it over may be intimidating. We frequently speak with small business owners who have these doubts, and there’s no question it can be an intimidating process. With these in mind, we’ve identified common ownership transitions that need to be addressed in an exit strategy: Founder/Owner Family Transition Partnership Buy/Sell Sell to Management Team Founder/Owner Most small companies are owned and operated by a founder, so this transition tends to be most common when small business owners look to sell their business. When you’ve been running a company for decades, your presence is often critical for the stability of the business. This presents a challenge when seeking an exit because the business may struggle to operate without you, negatively impacting the value of the business. Put simply, your business won’t let you retire. We phrase this as being at the crossroad of ownership transition and management succession. Let’s say you have taken a less-active role in your business, and the management team has been running the company for quite some time. In this case, management succession is easy to accomplish because there’s little operational risk following your departure. This drives the value of your business up and allows successful ownership transition to occur. On the other hand, if you’ve built the company from the ground up and have been a necessity since its formation, management succession will be more difficult. Because your presence is mandatory for the business to operate, the risk associated with your departure will drive down the value of the business. Consider asking yourself these questions to get a sense of how valuable you are to your business. In some instances, the owner decides they want some liquidity, but still want to be involved in management. This is known as a partial sale and is ideal for owners looking to get out of the day-to-day responsibilities, but still play an important role going forward. It can also be an exciting option when a business owner is seeking help in addressing potential growth opportunities - a concept known as growth support. Growth support allows small business owners to raise capital while acquiring a strategic and financial partner to assist in realizing the business’ growth potential. This is more of a phased approach to an eventual exit, allowing business owners to take “a second bite of the apple” before seeking a complete exit. Family Transition The sale of a family business from one generation to another is an excellent opportunity to achieve liquidity while keeping family members involved in the business. A family transition has the ability to not only give family owners liquidity but achieve the often competing needs of family businesses: Retained family ownership; Ongoing employment for family members; Distribution of sale proceeds among active and inactive family members; Family legacy in the community; Management succession between generations; Potential introduction of non-family management. See how we approach these considerations. Family transitions can often be a double-edged sword, especially when multiple generations are involved. Trying to please everyone in an exit strategy can be difficult, and if improperly managed, lead to the destruction of family relations. Another consideration to keep in mind is whether a transition can be achieved without external funds. Owners frequently come to us seeking financing because the family doesn’t have the necessary capital to complete a multi-generational ownership transition. Partnership Buy/Sell It is common for business partners to have different retirement horizons. When one decides to move on and the other wants to stay, a partnership buy/sell agreement can be an optimal exit strategy. Essentially, this agreement allows you to retire and your partner to take over the company. Additional benefits of a partnership buy/sell include: It provides assurance for the future of the company; There isn’t another buyer that knows your business as well as your partner; Selling to your partner ensures a competent buyer who understands the industry, market, customers, etc. The biggest problem we see during this process is liquidity: one partner wants to sell their stake, but the other doesn’t have the financing to buy their partner's stake. A common solution to this is the issuance of a seller note. A seller note is a form of financing in which the seller agrees to take the purchase price in a series of payments. Seller notes act like debt in the sense that they get paid back over a maturity date and have associated interest. We’ve gone in-depth with seller notes. Sell to Management Team This approach offers the same overall benefit of a partnership buy/sell agreement:  leaving the business in the hands of an experienced team and achieving some liquidity. Much like a partnership buy/sell agreement, a seller note is a common form of financing used to fund the acquisition of a business from an owner by a management team. That is, the owner/seller issues a note to the management team to “fund” the purchase. A potential downfall in this strategy is that the owner/seller will lack control of the company and its strategy going forward. Management teams might choose to pursue different growth initiatives following the sale. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it can become problematic given the “series of payments over time” aspect of a seller note. A seller’s future liquidity is dependent on the success of the management team’s performance. Other Exit Strategies Selling your business tends to be the most common approach for small business owners seeking an exit; however, alternative strategies may align with your vision. Employee Stock Ownership Plan An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) allows a business owner to sell all, or a portion, of their business to their employees. The cash proceeds from the sale are then transferred to the owner, generating liquidity and formalizing the owner's departure from the business. An ESOP is not a traditional corporation (S Corp, C Corp, LLC). It is a tax-favored trust fund that serves as an employee benefit plan. One purpose of an ESOP is to incentivize employee performance through stock-based compensation. From a business owner’s perspective, creating an ESOP can be ideal if you’re looking to grow the company with current employees. Aligning employee interests with shareholder interests can lead to greater employee engagement, increasing the chances of future success. Owners who pursue an ESOP also enjoy the benefit of not having to find a buyer. This can be especially helpful if you want to avoid a sale process or if your management team doesn’t have the financing to buy you out. While this can be an effective exit strategy, there are potential issues that can harm the operational flexibility of the business, such as repurchase obligations, legality concerns, and strict regulations. Read more on these issues here. Merger Merging is the process of “uniting” with another company to form a single entity. The transition entails a voluntary agreement between firms who operate in the same industry, are roughly the same size, have similar customers, etc. This is the ideal scenario if you find a compatible company whose interests and operations align with your own. A successful merger can help realize benefits between companies, boost market share, and improve overall efficiency. In other words, 1+1=3. Investopedia has written at greater length on what to look for in corporate mergers. One of the biggest problems with this strategy is the time and dedication involved in making it work. Owners who decide to merge are often more focused on the long-term potential of the company rather than using it as a means of exiting their business in the short term. Going Public and Liquidation These strategies are much less common small businesses exit strategies. Going public involves an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”), a process in which new shares of the company are issued to the public. Once completing the lengthy process, your business will have to abide by a new set of regulations, management will have to align with stakeholders’ interests, etc. Ultimately, you forfeit control of the company to the public. It’s a very expensive process and not a good fit for small company exit strategies. Liquidation is usually the outcome of a business not performing well. This exit involves ending the business and distributing its remaining assets accordingly. Unfortunately, though undesirable, this happens to companies often. When a company is unable to pay back its dues, owners will liquidate their business to get a sense of closure. Tips on Writing an Exit Strategy When formulating an exit strategy, there are many factors to consider: Seek guidance from trusted advisors, including accountants, attorneys, fellow business owners, friends, family, etc. Just remember an ideal exit strategy should be tailored to YOUR needs and desires; approaching the process with this mindset will ensure an optimal outcome. Conclusion You have put decades of work into your business. Putting together an exit strategy is the first step in protecting the future of your business and achieving the best outcomes for you. Hadley has acquired and assisted companies seeking this, tailoring each approach to the owner’s unique situation.

Key Takeaways: The most basic net working capital definition is: Accounts Receivable + Inventory - Accounts Payable Working capital adjustments and working capital cycle/cash conversion cycle are commonly confused, but are distinct concepts which rely on the same inputs. This blog explores working capital adjustments. In general, the lower amount of working capital a business can maintain, the better (However, cash constraints can limit operations if working capital is too low). In this blog post, I’m going to answer the following common questions we hear in regards to working capital adjustments: What Are Working Capital Adjustments and Why Do We Use Them? Do Working Capital Adjustments Impact Purchase Price? How Do We Calculate Working Capital? Is It Better to Have High or Low Working Capital? What Are Working Capital Adjustments & Why Do We Use Them? Working capital represents the liquidity required to operate a business from day to day. Generally, working capital includes current assets (e.g. accounts receivable) and current liabilities (e.g. accounts payable). Net working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. A Working Capital Adjustment captures the performance (good or bad) of a business between executing a Letter of Intent (LOI) and closing an acquisition. It is designed to convey to the seller the ‘appropriate’ amount of working capital required to operate the business and to ‘adjust’ for amounts higher or lower. A properly structured working capital adjustment will not benefit or penalize the seller or the buyer. According to Thomas Reuters Practical Law, “a buyer acquiring a target company or business needs to make sure that the target company or business has enough working capital after the closing to continue its operations as previously conducted by the seller. If working capital is inadequate, the buyer needs to infuse more cash into the business, effectively increasing the purchase price it is paying.” The inverse is also true - if working capital is artificially high, the seller has funded additional cash into the business, effectively decreasing the purchase price paid by the buyer. Working capital adjustments can sometimes be confused with working capital cycle or cash conversion cycle because they rely on the same inputs. These concepts are separate and distinct from working capital adjustments and are covered in this article regarding cash management techniques. Do Working Capital Adjustments Impact Purchase Price? Working capital adjustments are included in nearly all transactions but a properly structured working capital adjustment does not impact the purchase price as we outline below. The most important component of a Working Capital Adjustment is the Working Capital Target. The Target is negotiated between buyer and seller as part of the LOI. It determines the 'appropriate' level of working capital to be delivered at closing and 'appropriate' meaning the amount of working capital required to operate the business. The most common method for determining the working capital target is by calculating the average trailing twelve-month working capital amounts. If the Working Capital at Closing is more than the Target, more cash is due to the seller. If the Working Capital at Closing is less than the Target, the cash due to the seller is decreased. But the net impact to buyer and seller will be zero. How Do We Calculate Working Capital Adjustments? The calculation for working capital adjustments is best explained with context. A simple example will help illustrate: In the negotiation of an LOI, the Working Capital includes only Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable and the buyer and seller agree to set the Working Capital Target at $10: At closing, the actual working capital of the seller's business is as follows: Working Capital at Closing ($13) exceeds the Working Capital Target ($10) by $3 so the Seller receives an additional $3 at closing. From LOI to closing, the seller's business grew and, as a result, the balance sheet of the business grew. Accounts receivable increased from $20 to $25, requiring the seller to fund $5 of cash into the business. The accounts payable also increased from $10 to $12, a source of $2 cash to the seller. The net impact of the increase in accounts receivable (fund $5) and accounts payable (get $2) was $3 in cash funded by the seller into the business to support working capital growth. In other words, the Working Capital Adjustment 'worked'. The net impact to the seller was $0 because the seller recaptures the $3 funded into working capital. The net impact to the buyer was $0 because the buyer paid an additional $3 for a balance sheet that was $3 larger than at LOI. This example can obviously work in both directions but the outcome will be the same – neither buyer nor seller will benefit or be penalized by the working capital adjustment - and the net purchase price will not be impacted. Take a look at the graphic below to see these calculations from both the buyer and seller’s perspectives. Is It Better to Have High or Low Working Capital? The answer depends on the company and here’s why: An 'appropriate' amount will be specific to each company and must take into consideration seasonality, growth, and a host of other factors. Generally speaking, the lower amount of working capital a business can maintain, the better. However, if working capital is too low, a business may face cash constraints that limit its operations. What to Keep In Mind Working Capital Adjustments are a confusing part of negotiating the sale of a business and can frequently derail a sale process. But, they are critical to ensuring the ‘appropriate’ level of working capital is conveyed to the buyer, ensures the seller is made whole if more than the ‘appropriate’ level is conveyed (and vice versa), and does not impact purchase price.

There are many items one needs to consider when determining enterprise value and equity value. In this post, we are going to cover the following items: How to Calculate Enterprise Value The Difference Between Enterprise Value and Equity Value Enterprise vs. Book Value How Market Capitalization Relates Enterprise Versus Equity Value in Small Company M&A How to Calculate Enterprise Value Enterprise value is equivalent to what a third party would pay for all of the stock and business assets of a firm. For a publicly traded company, calculating enterprise value is fairly straightforward: multiply the current share price by the number of shares outstanding then add outstanding debt. In a privately held company, calculating enterprise value is more difficult because the value of the underlying stock of the corporation is not as transparent. Equity value is the portion of a company’s total value, or its ‘enterprise value,’ that is attributable to its equity investors. It is calculated by taking a company’s enterprise value (that is, what a third party would pay for all of the stock and business assets of the firm) and subtracting the value of any debt or debt equivalents (such as capitalized leases) owed by the company and then adding the value of any excess cash or cash equivalents (such as liquid investment securities) owned by it. The resulting figure is the value available to the company’s equity holders, or its ‘equity value.' The Difference Between Enterprise Value and Equity Value We sometimes explain the difference between enterprise value and equity value by creating an analogy to someone’s home. The enterprise value of your home is the sale price of the home. The equity value of the home is what the homeowner puts in their pocket after paying off their mortgage debt. Two similar homes may sell for similar amounts but the owners will likely not end up with the same amount of proceeds because, more likely than not, they have different mortgage balances. The enterprise value is the same, the equity values are not. This Corporate Finance Institute video provides a nice overview of this analogy. Equity Value vs. Book Value Equity value is not the same as book value. The book value of a company is simply the difference between its assets and liabilities as shown on its balance sheet.  Book value is also sometimes known as net book value. Learn more about net book value and asset-based valuation approaches. A successful company with good cash flows will almost always have an enterprise value that exceeds its book value.  But this doesn’t mean that this same company will necessarily have a large equity value. If, for example, it is carrying a large amount of debt, then much (or even all) of its enterprise value will be attributable to its lender(s). Or consider a firm that is struggling and no longer profitable, but which generated a large amount of cash in the past and which cash has remained in the company instead of being distributed to its shareholders.  In this case its book value might exceed its enterprise value. How Market Capitalization Relates Another related concept is ‘market capitalization,’ a term used mostly by investors in public companies:  It is simply the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the stock price.  Since the stock price would already reflect the amount of any excess cash in the business, if any, to calculate the related enterprise value one simply adds the amount of any funded debt owed by the company to its market capitalization. Enterprise Versus Equity Value in Small Company M&A Firms like Hadley Capital usually write their letters of intent on a ‘debt free, cash free’ basis. For instance, consider a firm with $1 million in free cash flow which we have determined has an enterprise value of $5 million. The language in our letter of intent might read, “Hadley Capital will buy all of the stock and assets of Company XYZ for $5 million at cash at closing less any debt and plus any cash on the balance sheet at closing.  This is a debt free, cash free proposal.” The shareholders of that firm would then take this $5 million ‘enterprise value’ and subtract the value of any funded debt and add the value of any cash on their company’s balance sheet in order to determine their pre-tax proceeds from the transaction, or their ‘equity value.’ Companies with the same enterprise value may not have the same equity value because, as we described above, the amount of debt and cash in each company is likely not the same. A simple example: In terms of determining enterprise value, Hadley Capital utilizes detailed financial models to examine the past and likely future cash flows of each firm and then to discount these cash flows back to the present time. This is called ‘discounted cash flow, or DCF.’ We also use multiples of EBITDA as a shorthand way to think about valuation.  A larger firm with good management and steady cash flow will attract a higher multiple than a smaller firm with only a few customers and uneven earnings, for instance.  But this doesn’t mean the equity holders of the first firm will receive more proceeds, or equity value, than the second firm, such as if the smaller firm has no debt and a lot of cash on its balance sheet and the larger firm has a lot of debt and little or no cash on its balance sheet Next Steps Enterprise value and equity value are foundational concepts in business valuation but they are frequently misunderstood by business owners. Developing a clear understanding of how each is calculated and used in valuation settings is important because, depending on the circumstances, they can be dramatically different numbers.

A finder's fee is compensation paid to an individual or firm (often called an intermediary) for a referral or introduction that results in an M&A transaction between a buyer and a seller. Here, we’re going to cover several different aspects of finder’s fees: An Overview of Finder’s Fees in Small Company M&A Typical Finder’s Fee Agreement Fee Structure Transaction Value Finder’s Fee Agreement Sample Form and Timing of Finder’s Fee Payments Who Can Receive a Finder’s Fee? Why Do I Need a Finder’s Fee? The justification for paying a finder's fee is that, without the “finder”, the parties never would have been introduced and the transaction would not have taken place. The referral source or finder is compensated in much the same way that a commission is paid to other types of intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Finder’s fees are also sometimes referred to as “Success Fees”. That is, they are contingent upon and paid at the successful closing of an M&A transaction. An Overview of Finder’s Fees in Small Company M&A Since our founding more than 20 years ago, Hadley has worked successfully with buy-side M&A intermediaries that identify small company acquisition opportunities and introduce Hadley to business owners. We compensate these buy-side M&A intermediaries under a finder's fee agreement. Download a sample of our standard fee agreement here. Finder's fees are also used when an M&A intermediary is marketing a business for sale but the business owner has not entered into a sell-side fee agreement with the M&A intermediary. In this case, the M&A intermediary will seek a finder’s fee/success fee from the buyer. Note that this is not a standard intermediary/seller relationship but it is not entirely uncommon. Typical Finder’s Fee Agreement The two most important elements of a finder’s fee agreement are the fee structure and the definition of transaction value. These elements are strictly related as we describe below. Fee Structure Hadley’s standard finder's fee agreement includes a fee structure based on a Lehman Fee and is representative of a standard private equity finder’s fee agreement. The Lehman Fee structure was developed by Lehman Brothers and is the most common fee structure in small company mergers and acquisitions. We wrote an additional blog post covering the Lehman Fee structure that you can read here. A Lehman Fee is calculated as follows: 5% of 1st million of transaction value 4% of the 2nd million 3% of the 3rd million 2% of the 4th million And 1% of the remaining transaction value A Lehman Fee structure is the most standard and most common form of the fee arrangement in a Finder’s Fee Agreement. Less common fee arrangements include flat fee (typically as a percentage of the transaction value) and Double Lehman (10% of the 1st million, 8% of the 2nd million, etc., etc.). Finder’s fee agreements may also include a flat, monthly retainer fee paid to the finder (often called a Retained Fee Agreement) with the monthly retainer offset against a future Finder’s Fee. Investopedia has written at greater lengths about the Lehman Formula, as well. Definition of Transaction Value Since the fee amount is dependent on increments of transaction value, the definition of transaction value is very important. M&A transactions often include multiple baskets of "value" received by the seller. Obviously, cash is typically the most important to a seller but other sources of value are typically included in the definition of transaction value including, among other items: Most of the acquisitions completed by Hadley include substantial cash at closing, which makes calculation of the transaction value and finder’s fee relatively straightforward. However, other sources of consideration often come into play in small company acquisitions and can, collectively, be meaningful sources of Transaction Value (for the seller and, by extension, the finder). Finder’s Fee Agreement Sample Let’s take a look at how a finder’s fee would be calculated in a theoretical acquisition with a transaction value of $10,00,000. For simplicity's sake, we will assume that the entire transaction value was paid in cash at closing. A $10 million sale results in a $200,000 fee. Take a look at the visual below: Form and Timing of Finder’s Fee Payments From the sample above, the $200,000 finder’s fee is due, in cash, at the time of closing. It is often the case that the finder’s fee is included in the sources and uses of funds prepared by the buyer. Some finders may elect to invest a portion of the finder’s fee into the target company at closing, subject to approval from the buyer. This is often referred to as “rolling” a portion of the fee into the buyer’s equity pool that is required to complete the acquisition. If portions of the transaction proceeds relate to contingent payments, such as earn-outs and seller notes, a portion of the finder’s fee may be held back by the buyer and paid to the finder when (or if) the seller earns the contingent payments. Who Can Receive a Finder’s Fee? Traditionally, Hadley’s finder’s fee agreements were strictly between Hadley and buy-side M&A intermediaries. Buy-side M&A intermediaries are service providers whose only service is facilitating introductions between buyers and sellers. More recently, we are entering into finder’s fee agreements with non-traditional finders - trusted small business advisors including recruiters, organizational psychologists, and family business consultants. These advisors often develop significant relationships with business owners and are well-positioned to assist them in developing a plan to sell their business - including introducing them to potential buyers. So long as the finder’s fee relationship is transparent to the business owner, we have no issue engaging with these advisors. Typically, the business owner is fine with the arrangement as it helps them avoid paying a fee to a sell-side M&A advisor or intermediary. Why Do I Need a Finder’s Fee? Most finder’s fee agreements in small company M&A are fairly basic, easy to understand agreements. There is very little work required to put one in place and a well-structured agreement provides important benefits to both parties - finder and buyer/payor. The finder needs an agreement that spells out the arrangement between the finder and the buyer/payor including important elements like the fee structure and definition of transaction value (as described above). An agreement also provides important protection from a finder being cut out of a transaction between buyer/payor and seller. A buyer enters into a finder’s fee agreement with an expectation that the finder will be able to provide unique access to attractive acquisition targets. An agreement also protects the buyer as it will clearly outline how the finder is to be compensated and sets a term on the length of time that the finder and payor will be engaged. Hadley has acquired many small businesses under these finder’s fee arrangements and has paid millions of dollars in finder’s fees to our buy-side M&A intermediary partners through the years. If you are interested in learning more about working with Hadley under a finder’s fee arrangement, please learn more about the types of companies we own and seek to acquire. Contact us if you would like to discuss entering into a finder’s fee arrangement with Hadley or if you are marketing a business for sale and seeking a buyer-paid fee or a success fee. We promise a quick evaluation of the target and feedback to the intermediary regarding our level of interest. If we are not interested, we will tell you quickly so the opportunity can be shown to other parties. Paul Wormley - Managing Partner Paul joined Hadley in 2005.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/small-business-private-equity/operating-without-personal-guarantees TITLE: Operating Without Personal Guarantees BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Operating Without Personal Guarantees Clay Brock May 31, 2011 - 1 min read Business owners often tell us that one of the reasons they want to do a transaction is to avoid having personally guaranteed bank debt. We don't blame them. A personal guarantee means that in the case the business declines or fails, not only does the owner lose his livelihood and primary asset but he also can be asked to come out-of-pocket to make the lender whole. That's the stuff of nightmares, especially if the owner is later in his career. Hadley Capital is prohibited from making guarantees, and we don't ask our partners to make them either. When we are buying or recapitalizing a business, and the business owner keeps some equity in the company going-forward, this means he can rest assured that he wont have to pay back the bank sometime in the future.  It is hard to put a value on this this peace of mind. Hadley Capital is able to get bank and other debt that is not guaranteed because of our track record of success, our professional firm structure which gives lenders comfort that we'll act reasonably in periods of distress and because we put substantial equity into each deal. This is a powerful tool in terms of enabling us to structure effective transactions that work for everyone.

In contrast, a fundless sponsor is a group or individual seeking to identify acquisition candidates and negotiate acquisitions without having the equity financing required to complete the transaction up front (hence, they are ‘fundless').  Another type of fundless sponsor the search fund.  A search fund is a  group or individual that has raised a small amount of capital from investors to ‘search' for an acquisition target.  They will identify and negotiate a transaction with a target and then the investors will receive an option to invest in the target company, or not, as they so choose. Fundless sponsors raise the equity required to fund an acquisition after they have executed an LOI.  Since raising equity from investors is a notoriously difficult task, it is important for sellers to understand the likelihood that a fundless sponsor will actually close the transaction as proposed.  Good questions to ask include: Who are your proposed investors and have they invested with you in the past? What is your track record of closing transactions under the same terms as proposed? What are the fees that you are going to propose to your investors? How much money are you going to invest personally in this transaction? Hadley Capital has committed equity capital:  We have the money.  We raised it from wealthy individuals and institutional investors who have entrusted us with their capital.  Sellers should investigate each prospective buyer to determine how likely they are to raise the money needed to close on their particular transaction.

However, there are many other factors to consider when comparing private equity and venture capital.

What this means is that our limited partner investors have legally committed to provide us with the equity capital to buy these companies upon our request for the capital. We also use debt, both senior bank debt and sometimes mezzanine debt, to affect our transactions, thus the term ‘leveraged buyout.’ Mezzanine debt is sometimes also called sub-debt.  We’ve written at greater length on how mezzanine debt is structured. When people say ‘private equity’ what they usually mean is a firm that, via a limited partnership such as Hadley Capital Fund III, conducts leveraged buyouts of stable, private companies. The buyouts can range from $5 million to billions of dollars and everywhere in between - from small businesses to extremely large, public companies. For example, Hadley has completed buyouts of businesses with only $5 million of revenue. At the other end of the spectrum, a handful of megadeals are completed each year according to Harvard Law: “There were a number of $10 billion-plus PE deals in 2019, including Blackstone’s $18.7 billion purchase of the U.S. warehouse portfolio of Singapore-based GLP (the largest private real estate deal in history), EQT’s $10.1 billion purchase of Nestlé’s skincare unit, and the $14.3 billion sale of communications infrastructure services provider Zayo Group to Digital Colony Partners and EQT. In addition, in November, it was reported that KKR had approached drugstore giant Walgreens Boots Alliance about a potential $70 billion take-private transaction—a deal that, if successful, would be the largest LBO in history.” Buyouts most often include a change in majority control of the company. Thus, using the cash flows of their acquisition targets to make the interest and principal payments on the debt. But private equity can also refer to other types of investment strategies such as ‘venture capital’ and ‘growth equity.’ Venture capital and growth equity firms are often similarly structured - as limited partnerships with committed capital - but pursue different investment strategies. Private equity is also often compared to or confused with hedge funds. Although hedge funds can be considered another form of private equity (as they typically use private capital to pursue an investment strategy), there are significant differences between traditional private equity and hedge funds including fund liquidity, term, and structure and, most significantly, the “hedged” positions of a hedge fund. Venture Capital Firms Venture capital is a form of investing in which venture capital firms provide equity to support startup and early-stage companies that have very high growth potential, such as some companies in high technology, information technology, and biotechnology. Most venture capital investments are structured as minority equity positions among a group of investors each owning a minority equity position. Venture capital investments, unlike private equity buyouts, have high rates of failure but they can also result in home runs. Whereas in private equity the expected returns are more stable because the risk profile of the underlying company is less dynamic. That is, the probability of a home run is quite low but so is the probability of complete failure. Venture capital investors usually do not use any debt because high-growth companies often consume cash as opposed to providing cash flow that can be used to support leverage. If you’re in a startup that is in need of capital to spur rapid growth, the following resources on venture capital firms may be helpful: Pitchbook’s What is Venture Capital? Venture Capital 101 Blog Post Forbes’s How Venture Capital Works Business Insider’s How VCs Raise Mone Growth Equity Growth equity is a type of investment where a firm injects additional equity into a relatively mature company to help it expand more quickly by increasing working capital assets, purchasing new equipment, adding sales and marketing personnel, buying a competitor, etc. Companies that seek growth capital often do so to finance a transformational event. Growth capital investments can include both majority control and minority equity structures. Hadley Capital sometimes finds companies that need to do a leveraged buyout to provide liquidity for a retiring owner-operator, but which also need growth equity to grow in a targeted way. In these cases, we often think of the investment in two parts. In the first part, we provide the capital (equity and debt) to complete the buyout while also planning for the second part. That is, providing enough capital for completing the buyout while ensuring a robust balance sheet remains to support the growth strategy. The Difference Between Private Equity, Venture Capital, and Growth Equity So, what’s the difference between private equity, growth equity, and venture capital? To sum it up, private equity means the buyout of a stable firm using both equity and debt, whereas growth equity means injecting equity into a stable firm to increase its growth rate, and venture capital means the investment of equity into a newer, high-growth potential company when the chances of success are riskier. Iwoca distinguishes between the two in the graph below. They are all technically forms of private investment but they vary substantially in their risk and return profiles. Hadley Capital is primarily a private equity firm that sometimes makes growth equity investments. We do not make venture capital investments or invest in distressed situations, but we find it’s valuable to distinguish between the three so that business owners coming to us with questions know where to find the answers.

Through the years we have found that small company owners often don’t have a complete understanding of the types of financing sources used in a small company merger and acquisition transactions. As a result, we would like to do a small blog series to explain the various types of financing sources and address the related sentiments that “debt is bad” and  “private equity firms always over leverage”. In this post, we will be covering the following: Traditional Bank Debt Senior Term Loans Revolving Line of Credit Debt is Bad vs. Debt is Good Private Equity Firms and Over Leveraging How a Hadley Capital Transaction Works In general, there are three primary financing sources used in small company M&A transactions: traditional bank debt, mezzanine debt, and equity. Traditional Bank Debt We are going to start with traditional bank debt. Hadley uses two forms of traditional, commercial debt when acquiring a small business: a senior term loan and a revolving line of credit. Senior Term Loans Senior debt, also commonly called a senior term loan, is a loan received from a traditional commercial bank that has a specified repayment schedule and either fixed or floating rate interest. Senior debt used in small company M&A transactions is most typically a cash flow-based term loan, which means that instead of lending against physical assets the bank is lending against a company's consistent cash flow (or EBITDA). It is very common for banks to require personal guarantees from business owners when issuing senior term loans to a closely held, private company. These guarantees help protect the bank against the risk of loss associated with poor business performance. Hadley is able to operate without personal guarantees. The term (or duration) of a senior term cash flow loan is usually around 5 years. The rate of interest for a cash flow term loan is typically higher than an asset based term loan but pricing depends on current market rates and the company's financial characteristics and performance. The principal on senior term loans is typically paid in equal monthly (or quarterly) installments over the term. For example here is a typical amortization schedule for a $3 million term loan with a 5 year term: Revolving Lines of Credit The second type of traditional commercial debt that is commonly used in small company M&A transactions is a revolving line of credit. A revolving line of credit is an asset-based loan because the bank has a lien on the assets that support the line of credit. The two main assets that support a revolving line of credit are accounts receivable and inventory. The amount of these assets on a company’s balance sheet dictate the size of the line of credit. The lien on the assets, and the relative ease to realize the lien, allow banks to lend the money at lower rates than cash flow term loans. Revolving lines of credit tend to have a one year, renewable term. They are called “revolving” because a borrower will frequently borrow against and repay principal balances on a regular basis. Hence, the amount of credit extended or available “revolves” as borrowings and repayments are made. Banks protect themselves when issuing lines of credit by requiring borrowers to submit a borrowing base certificate. The borrowing base certificate determines how much money is available to a borrower on an asset-based revolving line of credit by 1) using advance rates and 2) excluding assets that cannot be turned into cash quickly. Advance rates are the amount of money a bank will lend against the face value of an asset, Typical advance rates are 80% on Accounts Receivable and 50% on Inventory. Excluding assets from a borrowing base means banks will not lend any money against the asset. A typical exclusion for Accounts Receivables is receivables that are 120 days past due.   A typical exclusion for inventory is “work in process” inventory, meaning inventory that is between raw material and a finished good. Below is a simplified version of a borrowing base certificate: Debt is Bad vs. Debt is Good Debt is not inherently good or bad. The perception of whether debt is bad or good is often related to risk tolerance and everyone’s tolerance for risk is different. However, regardless of one’s risk tolerance, it is important to recognize that debt can be an effective tool in small company M&A transactions. Small company owners are frequently averse to any form of debt because they perceive it to be too risky. And, if the owner is required to personally guarantee the debt, as is frequently the case, this perception of (unacceptable) risk is valid. In small company M&A transactions, debt financing provides a buyer with a source of low-cost financing that benefits the seller. How does a seller benefit from a buyer’s choice of financing? All else being equal, lower cost debt financing will increase a buyer’s return on equity. The higher expected return for a buyer, the more a buyer is willing to pay in an acquisition - to the benefit of the seller. Of course, too much of anything is generally not a good thing. Financing a transaction with 100% debt financing, if available, involves more risk (to the lender and the buyer) than a transaction using only 50% debt financing. Private Equity Firms and Over Leveraging This brings us to the conversation about private equity firms and their use of debt (or leverage) in leveraged buyout transactions. There is plenty of press about the use of debt by private equity firms  - much of it focused on how private equity firms use ‘too much' debt, and invariably involves a story of the resulting failure of an acquired company.  There are certainly private equity acquisitions that rely too heavily on debt financing and end poorly.  However, the vast majority of private equity transactions use appropriate debt levels. An analysis of recent middle market leveraged buyout transactions shows Debt/EBITDA ratios of approximately 5.5x. While this debt/EBITDA ratio may be higher than a Hadley acquisition (more on this below), it could be appropriate in a middle market transaction. For context, middle market companies are those with enterprise values between $100 million and $500 million. These are larger companies that likely have deep management teams, robust systems, diverse sources of revenue and strong market positions. These characteristics may support higher amounts of debt than smaller, less developed companies. How a Hadley Transaction Works At Hadley, our choice of financing sources is designed to provide the business with enough flexibility to grow while optimizing its cost of capital. A typical Hadley transaction will utilize a senior term loan, a revolving line of credit, and equity. Compared to larger M&A transactions, we typically borrow senior debt that represents about twice a company's annual EBITDA (commonly described as 2.0x Debt/EBITDA). That is, if the target company has $1 million in annual EBITDA, we borrow $2 million in senior term debt. In finance lingo, this is called "2x senior leverage". This amount of debt is much less than in larger transactions (and those transactions that show up in news stories). During strong economic times, large private equity acquisitions may use senior term debt of 7x Debt/EBITDA or more! Take, for instance, recent examples from SP Global and PE News. Senior debt is an important source of financing in small company M&A transactions. When used appropriately, it has benefits to both buyer and seller. Determining the “right” amount of senior debt in a transaction is significantly dependent upon the circumstances of the business and the transaction and the risk appetite of the borrower.

Hadley Capital focuses on buying solid small businesses with bright futures. Of the 1,000 or so businesses we evaluate each year, we negotiate to acquire less than 5%, so I think it is fair to say that these are some of the best small businesses in America. And since that's the case, it's just common sense to not break what isn't broken. So instead of coming in with grand plans for change, we seek to ‘first, do no harm' by taking 6 – 12 months getting to know the people running the company, learning more about the business, etc. Then, after building mutual trust and confidence, we begin implementing 1 – 3 strategic initiatives per year. We tend to focus initially on the lowest hanging fruit in order to achieve small wins that require relatively little capital and involve low risk of failure. In our experience, it's very difficult for a small business to successfully implement more than 1 – 3 strategic initiatives per year because small businesses are often resource constrained – in both human and financial resources. Our ‘first, do no harm' approach is also well aligned with our long term strategy. Since we're not looking to flip companies a couple years after acquisition we can take the time to make incremental improvements. We can create a lot of value in a business by consistently hitting singles over a long period of time…it's kind of like the power of compounding. This approach is delivering long term value in our companies. Whether we are working on improved fulfillment systems and processes or sales force development and training or new market or geographic expansion or add-on acquisitions or facility expansions or upgrades, we find the ‘first, do no harm' approach works…for us anyway.

As a group, the three of us are the second largest investor in our investment funds.  Our significant personal commitments make a big difference to owners that are considering selling their small business and to the managers of companies owned by Hadley Capital. Small company owners are often concerned that a buyer, particularly a private equity buyer, is going to wreck their company. Since my partners and I put up significant personal money to buy a company, we aren’t going to take crazy risks after we buy a company.  In fact, our motto is ‘first, do no harm.’ Back in 2005/2006 we spent more than a year working with Mark and Gayle Reed, the owners of SGA.  The Reeds were very concerned that the buyer of SGA recognize and appreciate the substantial contributions of SGA’s employees as well as the legacy created by the owners and their team over the last twenty years. My partners and I were able to address these concerns by pointing to our successful track record of working with small companies, our ‘first, do no harm’ approach, and our significant personal commitments involved in acquiring SGA. The managers of our companies also take comfort from the fact that my partners and I eat our own cooking.  Like most owners we don’t spend frivolously, we don’t fly first class or stay in fancy hotels.  But we do take a long-term view when evaluating critical business decisions. PSI, our packaging business in Phoenix, was faced with a decision to acquire a new piece of (expensive) foam production equipment. After evaluating the economics of the machine &  including projected utilization rates, improved efficiencies, labor savings, etc. – we (management and Hadley Capital) were disappointed that the pay back was longer than initially hoped. However, purchasing the machine was clearly in the best interest of the company (and our customers) over the long-term. PSI is now the only company west of the Mississippi with the capabilities provided by this new production equipment. My partners and I think and act like owners because we are owners. Many private equity buyers claim that they are long-term investors who think and act like owners but very few back it up with significant financial commitments. In fact, most private equity principals (the guys and gals making the investment decisions) have far less ‘skin in the game’. But I’ll save this topic for another post on another day.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/small-business-private-equity/what-is-ebitda-margin TITLE: EBITDA Margins: What Every Small Company Owner Needs to Know BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ EBITDA Margins: What Every Small Company Owner Needs to Know Clay Brock March 10, 2021 - 3 min read EBITDA margin is a popular term but it can't be found on any financial statement. It has to be calculated and is a great way for owners to see how much cash their company has brought in. In this post, we are going to answer the many questions surrounding this important financial indicator: What is EBITDA Margin? How to Calculate EBITDA How is EBITDA used in Business Valuation? Why are Interest, Depreciation, and Amortization Added Back in EBITDA? Does EBITDA include CapEx? Is EBIT or EBITDA Better? What is an EBITDA Bridge? What is EBITDA Margin? First of all, EBITDA is an acronym that stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Deprecation, and Amortization. Simply put, EBITDA margin is a company’s operating profit as a percentage of its total revenue that allows investors to compare a company’s financial performance to others in the industry according to Investopedia. Calculating EBITDA is an excellent shorthand way to determine how much cash a company has generated from its business operations. This is significant because cash generated from operations is the primary driver of business valuation. How to Calculate EBITDA To calculate EBITDA, simply take the net income (Earnings) shown at the bottom of any income statement and add to it any interest, income tax, depreciation, and/or amortization expenses also shown on that income statement. The result is EBITDA. For instance, consider a manufacturer with $10 million of revenue, $4 million of gross profit, and $1.2 million of net income (earnings). If this manufacturer’s expenses as shown on its income statement were to include $100,000 of interest expense, $400,000 of income taxes ,and $300,000 of depreciation, its EBITDA would be $2.0 million and its EBITDA margin would be 20%. Watch the video below for another example: How Is EBITDA Used in Business Valuation? To determine a company’s EBITDA valuation, we take its recent annual EBITDA (or its EBITDA less Capex or EBIT, as the case may be) and multiply it by a figure (a ‘multiple’), typically between 4 and 5. The multiple we use is dependent on the past and likely future consistency of a company’s EBITDA and its potential to grow over time. For instance, a company that has just a few customers and sees its EBITDA go up and down wildly from year to year would result in a low multiple (maybe 2-4x), while a company with a very steady and growing EBITDA would attract a higher multiple (5x, or more). Other factors that impact the EBITDA multiple include the size of a company (bigger is better), its EBITDA margin (typically, investors such as Hadley Capital want to see EBITDA margins in excess of 10%), and the amount of capital expenditures required to maintain and grow the company. Why are Interest, Depreciation, and Amortization Added Back in EBITDA? Why do we add-back interest? The interest expense a company pays is dependent on how much debt it has. If a business has a lot of debt, then it will have a lot of interest expense. The identical business without any debt will have zero interest expense. Because the debt structure of a company is not related to how much cash its operations generate (only where that cash goes) interest is added back in the EBITDA formula. The amount of income tax expense a company pays is, like debt, highly dependent on items such as its corporate form (S Corp v. C Corp), accounting practices, the amount of debt it has, and other factors not in any way related to its operating performance. This is why income taxes are also added back to the EBITDA formula. Depreciation and Amortization are added back in the calculation of EBITDA because they are non-cash charges against earnings. Depreciation reflects the declining value of a tangible asset (like a piece of equipment) as it wears out or becomes obsolete, while Amortization reflects the declining value of an intangible asset (like a patent) as its useful life declines. The accounting treatment of depreciation and amortization rarely reflect the real "costs" associated with acquiring/owning these assets and, since they are non-cash charges, adding back depreciation and amortization better reflects current-period cash flows. Does EBITDA include CapEx? Another common question that comes up when calculating EBITDA is if capital expenditures are included. The short answer is no and here’s why: there is one important caveat related to depreciation. Buying tangible assets (like equipment) is a real cash cost (typically referred to as capital expenditures or ‘CapEx'). CapEx shows up on the balance sheet in the form of additional fixed assets instead of the income statement as an expense. As a result, we often refer to a company's 'EBITDA less CapEx' instead of just its EBITDA, or we might instead refer to that company’s EBIT, which is just its EBITDA without the depreciation and amortization add-backs. Is EBIT or EBITDA Better? Hadley Capital typically uses EBIT as the primary proxy for a company’s cash flow when that company has lots of recurring capital expenditures, such as one that uses lots of vehicles or which needs to buy new equipment every few years to stay competitive in its industry. In doing so, we assume that the company’s depreciation expenses will generally line up with its CapEx each year. For a company with periodic large capital expenditures, we typically refer to its ‘EBITDA less CapEx.’ These sort of businesses often have a large amount of depreciation and so if we were to just look at EBITDA we would miss the large capital expenditures and the associated valuation would be meaningless. And we use just EBITDA for companies that have only modest periodic capital expenditures such as in certain service businesses or distributors. Neither EBIT nor EBITDA is better per se, they’re just more appropriate in different circumstances. What is an EBITDA Bridge? Another way we use EBITDA is to build an EBITDA bridge to allow us to see in more detail what is contributing to a company’s changes in cash flow from one period to the next. The way to make a simple EBITDA bridge is as follows: Step One:  take a company’s revenue, gross profit margin, and SG&A costs from one period, say 2018, and strip out all of the interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization embedded in each of the cost of sales and SG&A, and then to do the same for another, similar length period, say 2019. Step Two: Use the resulting adjusted gross profit % from the first period and multiply it by the difference in revenue. That’s the amount of the EBITDA change attributable to the growth or reduction in revenue between the periods. Step Three: Then, take this figure and subtract it from the actual change in gross profit between the periods. This is the amount of the EBITDA change that’s attributable to the change in the gross profit % between the periods. Step Four: Next, look at any changes to the amount of SG&A. That’s the amount of the EBITDA change that’s attributable to changes in the company’s overhead expenses. Doing this for multiple periods in a row is a great way to see how a business is performing and adapting over time.  Here is an example: The Importance of EBITDA In the end, EBITDA is just a quick way to think about the cash flow of a business. But that’s why we use it so much; it allows us to quickly reference how a company is doing in relation to other firms. When considering speaking about a potential acquisition, we might say: ‘This is a manufacturing business. It has 40 employees, a revenue of $7 million, and an EBITDA margin of $1.3 million. EBITDA has been relatively steady for the past few years, and no customer represents more than 5% of revenue. We’ve offered 5x EBITDA.’ Because of this, EBITDA is an important metric for any business owner to understand. Whether you’re seriously considering selling or still exploring the idea, you’ll want to get a ballpark figure of what your business is worth. After calculating your EBITDA margin, visit our Business Valuation Calculator to get an estimate of what your business may be worth. It only takes 5 minutes and requires no further commitment on your part P.S. Check out Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders for an entertaining sidebar on the topic of EBITDA & 2000 letter (page 16) and 2002 letter (page 20).

In this blog, we’re going to cover the following: What Is EBITDA? EBITDA vs. EBT and EBIT EBITDA vs. Operating Cash Flow Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin EBITDA Formula + Calculations Adjusted or Normalized EBITDA What is an EBITDA Bridge? The Drawbacks of EBITDA EBITDA and Leveraged Buyouts How Is EBITDA Used in Business Valuation? What is EBITDA? EBITDA is a shorthand way for investors to determine how much cash a company generates, especially in comparison to other firms. It allows us to quickly look at the core cash earnings of a company by eliminating the impact of capital structure and excluding income taxes and certain other non-cash expenses that appear on the income statement. The amount of interest a company pays is dependent on how much funded debt that firm has on its balance sheet. If a company has a lot of debt relative to its equity then we say it’s got a ‘leveraged balance sheet.’  Different companies have different levels of debt. This is not necessarily a good or bad thing, rather it's just something that’s different from firm to firm. If a business has a lot of debt it will have a lot of interest expense while the identical business without any debt will obviously have zero interest expense.  This is why we want to eliminate the impact of capital structure when we are evaluating earnings. Said another way, because the debt structure of a company is not related to how much cash its operations generate, only where that cash goes, we add interest back to calculate EBITDA. The same principle holds true for taxes. Much like debt, the amount of tax a company pays is highly dependent upon such things as its corporate form (S Corp v. C Corp, for instance), its accounting practices, the amount of debt it has, and other factors not related to its operating performance. This is why we add taxes back to calculate EBITDA. Why do we add-back depreciation and amortization? Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges against earnings. Depreciation reflects the declining value of a tangible asset (like a piece of equipment) as it wears out or becomes obsolete. Amortization reflects the declining value of an intangible asset (like a patent) as its useful life declines. The accounting treatment of depreciation and amortization rarely reflect the real "costs" associated with acquiring/owning these assets and, since they are non-cash charges, adding back depreciation and amortization better reflects current-period cash flows. There is one important caveat related to depreciation and amortization:  buying tangible assets like equipment or trucks is a real cash cost (which we typically refer to as capital expenditures or ‘capex'). Capex shows up on the balance sheet in the form of additional fixed assets instead of on the income statement as an expense. So especially for businesses that have recurring capital expense needs, we often refer to its ‘EBITDA less capex.' That way we can better reflect its cash earnings in comparison to other firms with lower recurring capex needs. Warren Buffet’s annual shareholder letter from 2002 provides a glimpse into the rationale for deducting capital expenditures from EBITDA. EBITDA vs. EBT and EBIT Just as EBITDA is a short-hand calculation to approximate the cash produced by a business, EBIT and EBT are further simplifications. EBIT is simply Earnings Before Interest and Taxes and is roughly equivalent to a company’s Operating Income. Operating Income is typically a subtotal found on a company’s profit and loss statement and calculated as Gross Profit - Operating Expenses. EBIT can be a proxy for a company’s cash flow when that company has lots of recurring capital expenditures, such as one that uses lots of vehicles or which needs to buy new equipment every few years to stay competitive in its industry. Because Depreciation and Amortization are excluded from the calculation, EBIT assumes that the company’s depreciation expenses will generally line up with its capital expenditures each year. EBT is Earnings Before Taxes but inclusive of interest. Also known as pre-tax income. EBITDA vs. Operating Cash Flow As described in the opening paragraphs, EBITDA is a shorthand way for investors to determine how much cash a company generates by eliminating the impact of capital structure on its earnings and by also excluding certain other non-cash expenses that appear on the income statement. However, EBITDA does not account for the cash used in a business to fund changes in working capital. Working capital is the cash or liquidity required to operate a business. Read more on working capital from Investopedia. Operating Cash Flow is found on a company’s statement of cash flows. It also provides a view into how much cash a company generates. Like EBITDA, it excludes certain non-cash expenses like depreciation. However, Operating Cash Flow is different from EBITDA in two respects: Operating Cash Flow uses Net Income as its earnings starting point so it does not eliminate the impact of capital structure on earnings (that is, interest expense is included in Net Income). Operating Cash Flow does take into consideration changes in net working capital Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Practitioners like Hadley often add non-recurring items back to EBITDA. These “add-backs” reflect expenses that a buyer expects will not be in the business in the future such as: Duplicative rent during a move to a new facility; Expenses related to implementing a major new enterprise software solution; A business owner’s above market compensation and/or perks, such as a luxury car lease. Just as there are positive add backs to EBITDA, there can also be negative adjustments. Examples of negative adjustments may include: The addition or replacement of a key management position (at a new or higher salary amount) One time project or revenue that is non-recurring The net result of positive add-backs and negative adjustments included in EBITDA is referred to as ‘adjusted EBITDA’.  That is, EBITDA is adjusted to present a more normalized view of cash flow. Finally, a company’s ‘adjusted EBITDA margin’ is another very important indicator of its relative performance. EBITDA margin = Adjusted EBITDA/Total Revenue EBITDA margin is expressed as a percentage.  We like to see adjusted EBITDA margins of 10% or greater. We’ve written at greater length on EBITDA margins. EBITDA Formula + Calculation When it comes to actually calculating EBITDA, the formula itself is quite straightforward: EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization E = Net Income B = Before the following I = Interest T = Taxes D = Depreciation A = Amortization We’ve found that it is helpful to provide detailed examples of calculations like EBITDA. We created a fictional business called Bob’s Tees R Us to help with these examples. In this case, we will use Bob’s Tees income statement, presented below, to calculate EBITDA: EBITDA = Net Income + Interest expense + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization Adjusted or Normalized EBITDA The next step in the process is to adjust EBITDA for unusual or non-recurring items. For example, Bob received a $50,000 order to a company that subsequently went out of business. Bob subsequently wrote-off $50,000 of uncollectible receivable as bad debt expense in his 2020 profit and loss statement presented above. Given the one-time nature of this event, it might make sense to adjust the historical earnings by adding this expense back to Net Income when calculating EBITDA. To take the example further, at Tees R Us, Bob has an employee who does not work.  His son is on the payroll but prefers to spend his time practicing drums.  In addition, his son is highly compensated for not working – he makes $20 per hour or about $50,000 per year. Furthermore, Bob runs some personal expenses through the company including his golf club dues because he regularly hosts customers at his golf club.  His golf club expenses totalled about $15,000 last year but this form of customer entertainment is not critical to maintaining these relationships going forward.  Finally, Bob lost a labor lawsuit with a former employee and had to pay a $125,000 settlement.  Hopefully, this is nonrecurring! Taking all these items into consideration, Tees R Us has an adjusted EBITDA as follows. EBITDA Margin Bob’s Tees EBITDA Margin is simply Adjusted EBITDA/Total Revenue. $7,015/$19,500 = 36% What is an EBITDA Bridge? Another way we use EBITDA is to build an EBITDA bridge to allow us to see in more detail what is contributing to a company’s changes in cash flow from one period to the next. A simple EBITDA bridge can be completed in four steps. Let’s go back to Bob’s Tees R Us to walk through the process of building an EBITDA bridge: Step One:  From Bob’s Tees income statement, remove interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization embedded in Cost of Goods Sold and SG&A in 2019 Then to do the same for 2020. Step Two: Use the resulting adjusted gross profit % from 2019 and multiply it by the difference in revenue between 2019 and 2020. The result ($577) is the amount of the EBITDA change attributable to the growth or reduction in revenue between 2019 and 2020. EBITDA Bridge Takeaway: Bob’s Tees experienced solid revenue growth over the last year of $1,500. Thanks to high gross margins and relatively fixed overhead, EBITDA will increase by $577. Step Three: Then, take the amount from Step 2 and subtract it from the actual change in gross profit dollars between the periods. This is the amount ($1,138) of the EBITDA difference that is attributable to the change in the gross profit % between 2019 and 2020. EBITDA Bridge Takeaway: Bob’s Tees improved its gross profit margin in 2020 due to a significant reduction in labor expense. The combination of more revenue and higher gross profit margins results in EBITDA increasing by $1,138. Step Four: Next, look at any changes to the amount of SG&A. That’s the amount of the EBITDA change that’s attributable to changes in the company’s overhead expenses. EBITDA Bridge Takeaway: Bob’s Tees has done a nice job keeping a lid on operating expenses during a period of growth. The increase in rent from $200 to $300 results in an EBITDA decrease of $100 between periods. Overall, despite a small increase in operating expenses, EBITDA increased by $1,615 due to higher revenue and improved gross margins. An EBITDA bridge is an effective tool for comparing multiple periods in a row and to create insights into how a business is performing and adapting over time.  While our example covers only two periods, it is not uncommon for an EBITDA bridge to cover many periods. The Drawbacks of EBITDA EBITDA is a very useful metric for understanding a company’s cash flow especially in relation to other firms from an investor’s perspective. That said, it has its limitations as in the end it is really just an abbreviated proxy for cash flow. In order to fully evaluate a firm’s cash flow, which is very important to investors like Hadley who seek to use leverage to affect their transactions (thus the term ‘leveraged buyouts’), we utilize much more complete financial models. EBITDA and Leveraged Buyouts These financial models seek to account for all of the factors that can impact a firm’s cash flow, including its working capital and capex needs (which can be very significant, especially during times of growth), and shows us the impact of using various forms of leverage such as bank term debt, bank lines of credit and mezzanine debt. Debt is a very useful tool in the world of leveraged buyouts but having too much debt relative to a firm’s cash flow is a problem we want to avoid.  Thus, we seek to fully understand a target company’s cash flow, not just its EBITDA. But in terms of a shorthand way to understand a company, there’s no metric we use more than EBITDA. How Is EBITDA Used in Business Valuation? EBITDA is used to approximate the enterprise value of a business by multiplying EBITDA by a factor (called an EBITDA Multiple) to arrive at a valuation. To determine a company’s EBITDA valuation, we take its recent annual EBITDA (or its EBITDA less Capex or EBIT, as the case may be) and multiply it by an EBITDA Multiple, typically between 4 and 5. One important note that can often confuse business owners. This approach to valuation results in an Enterprise or Market Value of the target business not the Equity Value. Equity Value is the Enterprise Value less any debt plus any cash. More on Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value is available at Investopedia. The EBITDA Multiple we use is dependent on the past and likely future consistency of a company’s EBITDA and its potential to grow over time. For instance, a company that has just a few customers and sees its EBITDA go up and down wildly from year to year would result in a low multiple (maybe 2-4x), while a company with a very steady and growing EBITDA would attract a higher multiple (5x, or more). Other factors that impact the EBITDA multiple include the size of a company (bigger is better), its EBITDA margin (typically, investors such as Hadley want to see EBITDA margins in excess of 10%), and the amount of capital expenditures required to maintain and grow the company.

[FAQ + Guide] BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ What are Fundless Sponsors? [FAQ + Guide] Clay Brock August 16, 2021 - 2 min read Private equity funds are pooled investment vehicles that are raised from a group of sophisticated investors to pursue a specific investment strategy. Each investor in the fund makes a binding commitment to provide capital to the fund. Private equity funds are closed-end, meaning they have a finite life, typically 10 - 15 years. A fundless sponsor is a group or individual seeking to identify acquisition candidates and negotiate acquisitions without having the equity financing required to complete the transaction upfront (hence, they are ‘fundless'). The term “sponsor” creates a distinction between the individual or group “sponsoring” the acquisition and the investors who are providing the capital. In a fundless model, the sponsor and the investors are distinct. Typically, with a private equity buyer, the sponsor and the investor are the same. In this post, we are going to discuss the types of private equity and fundless sponsors and how they work: Types of Buyers for Small Companies Fundless Sponsors Questions to Ask Fundless Sponsors Types of Buyers for Small Companies There are generally two types of buyers for small companies: Strategic buyers (like a larger competitor) and financial buyers (like Hadley Capital). Financial buyers generally fall into one of two categories:  Those with committed equity capital, and those without. Hadley has committed equity capital.  Our investors have made a binding, legal commitment to fund our acquisitions.  When we find an attractive acquisition candidate we can invest in that company without outside approval. Family offices are also a type of buyer with capital on hand to invest. Family offices are professional organizations that manage the investment and financial affairs for a single or multiple ultra-high net worth families. As part of a diversified investment strategy, some family offices will make investments in or acquire small companies. In contrast,  fundless sponsors typically must identify an investment opportunity and then raise the funds to complete the investment. Fundless sponsors go by many different names: Fundless sponsor Independent sponsor Search Fund Fundless sponsor Fundless sponsors identify acquisition opportunities and then raise capital to fund the acquisition. There is a certain element of “chicken vs. the egg” in this type of process - it is difficult to raise money without an identified acquisition and it is difficult to secure an acquisition without capital in hand. Some fundless sponsors raise all of the equity capital required to fund the acquisition from investors while other fundless sponsors contribute a portion of the equity from their own pocket. The majority of fundless sponsors have done zero to one acquisition. However, there are some very established and capable fundless sponsors that have completed a dozen or more acquisitions. The senior partners at Hadley started their careers as fundless sponsors completing four separate acquisitions. These acquisitions served as the track record to raise Hadley’s committed capital funds. Getting started as a fundless sponsor can be as simple as starting an informal search for target companies, browsing deal listing sites, and connecting with business brokers and intermediaries that represent small companies. The process can also be more formal and include establishing a company, naming it, building a website to describe yourself and your search, etc. The profile of a fundless sponsor varies widely - from experienced executives to newly minted MBAs and all points in between. In general, search funds are often headed by younger executives who have recently completed an MBA. More senior, experienced executives tend to operate as fundless or independent sponsors because they often have the resources (time and money) necessary to be picky - both in terms of identifying a funding source and acquisition target. Independent Sponsor The term “independent sponsor” has more recently displaced the less-friendly “fundless sponsor” moniker. Independent sponsors have the same characteristics of a fundless sponsor and the terms can be used interchangeably. Independent sponsors sometimes work with private equity funds or family offices as sources of equity capital. The combination of an independent sponsor and a funding source with committed or available capital can be mutually beneficial to both parties. The independent sponsor gets a source of funding and the private equity firm or family office may benefit from the work done by the independent sponsor to identify a proprietary investment opportunity, organize a value purchase, or contribute operating expertise to the target acquisition. Independent sponsors typically self-fund the process of identifying a potential acquisition candidate. At the closing of the acquisition, the independent sponsor often receives a closing fee. The size of the fee will vary depending on the size of the transaction. After closing, the independent sponsor may receive a monthly management or monitoring fee or, if the independent sponsor endeavors to run the business full-time, a regular salary. Search Funds Another type of fundless sponsor is the search fund. The two most common forms of a search fund are self-funded and sponsored searches. Self-funded searches are essentially the same as fundless sponsors. The self-funded search is just that, self-funded, and is the most common search model. That is, an individual looking to “sponsor” an acquisition but without the “funds” to complete it without support from a third party. The entrepreneur bears all the costs to find a suitable acquisition target. Once a business is found to purchase, the searcher determines the best funding strategy for the acquisition. Sponsored searches, also sometimes referred to as a “Traditional” search model, involves the searcher raising capital from investors to fund the search phase. Expenditures in the search phase include searcher salaries, office space, travel expenses, and due diligence costs for a period of up to two years. Investors typically receive preferred equity in the acquisition equal to 1.5x their investment. They also typically receive the right of first refusal to invest additional capital in the acquisition. But the investors are not committed, rather they have an option whether to invest, so a sponsored search is still fundamentally a “fundless” process. Questions for Sellers to Ask a Fundless Sponsor Fundless sponsors raise the equity required to fund an acquisition after they have executed a Letter of Intent to acquire a company. Since raising equity from investors is a notoriously difficult task, it is important for sellers to understand the likelihood that a fundless sponsor will actually close the transaction as proposed.  Good questions to ask include: Bradley Smith at Vertress lists some additional questions to ask fundless sponsors.

URL: https://hadleycapital.com/insights/valuation-guide TITLE: Business Valuation Guide | Hadley Capital BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Valuation Guide What is Your Business Worth? Common Methods of Valuation Ultimately, the value of anything being sold is what someone is willing to pay for it. There are, however, many accepted methods for determining value when it comes to your business: Book Value, Discounted Cash Flow, Multiple of Cash Flow, and Multiples of something else—for example, some industries are valued at a multiple of subscribers, a multiple of revenue, etc. Our Approach to Valuation Hadley Capital values Companies based on their ability generate sustainable, operating cash flows. We typically apply a multiple to the annual, sustainable operating cash flow of a business to estimate its value. We use EBITDA as a rough but good estimation of operating cash flow. To determine sustainable cash flow, we adjust EBITDA to include some positive and negative add backs. Positive add backs that increase EBITDA may include: Owners excess compensation Rental expense above market rates Owners' Benefits that are not required to run the business such as automobiles, vacations, etc. Add backs that may decrease EBITDA include: Rental expense below market value Substantial annual capital expenditures Additional salaries required when the owner departs A Valuation Tool EBITDA Multiples Once sustainable EBITDA is determined, Hadley Capital applies a multiple of EBITDA to determine the Enterprise Value of your business. In general, smaller companies typically trade for between 3x to 5x normalized EBITDA. The difference in the multiple is generally the result of a variety of characteristics specific to your business, including: Sales growth rate Gross Profit Margin Annual EBITDA EBITDA Margin Annual capital expenditures Working capital requirements Customer concentration The Structure of the Offer is Important Comparing Offers Not all offers are the same or comparable. Some buyers may offer a higher “headline number”, that suggests your business is worth more, but contingency payments like earnouts, seller financing requirements and complicated financing structures may add risk to the offer by stretching out payments over time rather than a single, substantial check at closing. Committed Capital At Hadley Capital, we are private equity investors with capital on hand, which means that most of our transactions involve substantial cash at closing. We can structure payment using a variety of financing techniques but most sellers prefer cash even if our valuation appears slightly lower than a competing offer with complicated or protracted buyout contingencies. We are happy to discuss options and explain how price differences really work and how cash can pay added dividends. Common Pitfalls Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value Hadley Capital’s valuations are almost always based on an enterprise value, rather than an equity value, and are usually on a cash-free, debt-free basis. As the seller, you are responsible for satisfying (paying off) any existing debts. Equity Value is what is left after subtracting debt from Enterprise Value. Enterprise Value and Equity value may be most easily understood by comparing them to someone’s home value. The Enterprise Value of a home is the total value of the home. The Equity Value of the house is the total value less the mortgage on the home. It’s the same with your business; Equity Value is what’s left after you pay off any debts. Working Capital Adjustment Working capital is the capital required to operate a business in a steady state environment. Hadley Capital acquisitions always include a working capital adjustment at closing. A working capital adjustment increases or decreases cash at closing based on the performance of the business between executing a LOI and closing a transaction. If the business grows between LOI and closing, the working capital adjustment will result in higher sale proceeds because the working capital grows. If working capital declines, the purchase price will be lower. The working capital adjustment is not meant to benefit the seller or the buyer but, rather, to compensate for balance sheet changes (to the positive or negative) between LOI and closing.

(“GT Golf”) recently announced that the company was acquired by Kinzie Capital Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm. GT Golf joined Hadley’s group of “small companies that punch above their weight” in 2016. Hadley’s acquisition of GT Golf was instrumental to founder Craig Pollard’s plan to achieve a management succession and ownership transition. Under the Hadley Ownership SystemTM, GT Golf completed a seamless leadership transition, allowing Craig to step away from the business and spend more time on his non-profit endeavors. Following the leadership transition, Hadley and GT Golf’s new management team invested in critical foundations to support future growth, including advanced information technology systems, new warehouse locations, expanding the team, and e-commerce capabilities. The results of these investments were dramatic – GT Golf delivered nearly 15% compounded annual growth over Hadley’s ownership period resulting in nearly tripling the company’s top and bottom lines. CIBC Cleary Gull served as the exclusive financial advisor to GT Golf. The financial terms of the transaction were undisclosed. Delivering for our companies Brian Van De Veere, President of GT Golf, shared, “We can’t thank the Hadley team enough for the last 6 years.  It’s definitely bittersweet as GT Golf could not have asked for a better partner to guide us on this journey.” He continued “When Craig informed us that he was selling GT Golf to a private equity group, Google did not have great things to say about what would be embarking on with a private equity owner. It became evident very early on that “this isn’t so bad”, and that we needed a group like Hadley to sharpen our skills and, ultimately, to unleash our potential.  Any small company in our situation should be thrilled for the opportunity to partner with Hadley.” Paul Wormley, Managing Partner at Hadley and Chairman of GT Golf added, “GT Golf is an excellent example of how the Hadley Ownership System helps small companies solve complex problems. It was a great honor to help Craig achieve his transition goals and to support GT Golf’s management team in growing the company during Hadley’s ownership.” Delivering for small company sellers Craig Pollard, founder of GT Golf, commented, “Hadley did exactly what we discussed back in 2015: provide my team with an opportunity to be owners, contribute guidance and support on how to more than double the size of the company, and deliver me a second bite at the apple. I could not have imagined it would work out this well.” “The partnership with Hadley was a great experience. I’m a little nostalgic as a company I started out of my garage in 1993 grew every year thanks to great people. I am very grateful for the lifelong friendships developed with employees, vendors, customers and now, the team at Hadley.” About the Hadley Ownership System The Hadley Ownership System was developed specifically to assist small companies achieve success in one of the most challenging periods in a small company’s lifecycle – a transition from a founder/owner to a new phase of leadership and ownership. Once the Transition is a success, the Hadley Ownership System is focused on orienting small companies towards a Growth model that creates greater opportunities for all its stakeholders – employees, customers, vendors, partners and owners.

Fund IV surpassed its target, demonstrating the strong support by Hadley’s investors for the firm's strategy. "We are grateful for the confidence our investors have placed in our approach over the past 20 years. Our results allowed us to raise Fund IV in record time despite significant dislocation in the alternative asset fundraising environment," said Paul Wormley, Managing Partner at Hadley. "Hadley originated small company investing with the belief that we could assist owners, families, and management teams with transitioning and improving small companies – cumulatively, these businesses represent a critical portion of US economic output and employ nearly half of US workers.” Hadley Capital Fund IV will advance Hadley’s proven strategy and partnership-driven approach. Hadley supports small company owners seeking ownership and management transition and has a track record spanning nearly 20 years. In Fund IV, Hadley will continue to acquire leading small companies, apply the Hadley Ownership System™ to provide critical operational and strategic support to its companies, and address the often complex needs of all stakeholders in a small company. "Hadley is the unique firm where limited partners, the general partner, target company sellers, and portfolio company stakeholders are closely aligned. Over the last two decades, Hadley has developed a system for creating value across this spectrum and the results are differentiated in today’s private equity marketplace. Our success in raising Fund IV against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment is a validation of what we’ve built," said Clay Brock, Managing Partner at Hadley. In addition to raising Fund IV, in the last 12 months, Hadley has completed three realizations and two small company acquisitions. In aggregate, Hadley has acquired 30 small companies, delivering significant value to small company stakeholders, owners partnered with Hadley, and Hadley investors. “Owners of small companies that are seeking management and ownership transition deserve an experienced and capable partner in a critical time in the life cycle of their business. These small company owners appreciate not only our experience but also our personal investments in our Fund and our partnership approach”, added George Malone, General Partner at Hadley. Fund IV is composed of a small group of sophisticated limited partners who value the ability to access the small company private equity market via a proven general partner that has committed nearly 25% of the capital to Fund IV. HMB Legal Counsel served as fund counsel for Fund IV.
