Dan Sullivan, Managing Director for Utilities at Vertex, commented, "We're absolutely delighted to be recognized as the global number one BPO provider in the Utilities industry. Our acquisition of Alliance Data's Utility Services division last year clearly strengthened our commitment to the industry and our ability to effectively fulfill our clients' BPO needs to help them take advantage of opportunities in our new 'smart world.' This number one ranking validates the strong partnerships we have established with our clients in this rapidly changing industry."

"Vertex has earned the distinction of being one of the most customer-respected BPO companies in the world,"" said Doug Brown, co-author of The Black Book of Outsourcing. "Vertex has earned top honors due to its ability to deploy consistently across the full spectrum of criteria that clients look for in their BPO provider. In addition, Vertex was overwhelmingly praised by clients in the four most important attributes clients look for in an outsourcing partner: vertical expertise, innovation, customization and reliability."

Paul Sweeny, Chief Executive Officer of Vertex, concluded, "While Vertex today supports many industries globally, we got our start in the Utilities industry well over a decade ago. Therefore, this number one ranking has special significance for our 8,000 Vertex associates worldwide. Utilities are undergoing rapid transformation, so we are pleased that our expertise and strengths have enabled us to be the BPO provider of choice in this exciting and dynamic industry."

The day’s agenda included topics from best practices for PE firms to improve operations in niche manufacturing portfolio companies to the most important things a PE firm has to get right when exiting a niche manufacturing investment. Matt is a firm believer that operations is the key lever to opening new opportunities in private equity investing in manufacturing companies.  “At GenNx360 Capital Partners, operations is the core of our strategy.  Several of my partners used to be front-line operating executives at General Electric. They led diverse industrial businesses, generating billions in operating profits.  Collectively, we target investments in industrial sectors where we have operational and managerial experience including specialty chemicals, industrial machinery and components, energy, transportation and logistics, agriculture, and aerospace and defense.” said Matt. Since 2006 when GenNx360 was founded, niche manufacturing has been revolutionized. The most obvious example is that ten years ago the big new trend was off-shoring.  Now the tide is coming back, and the big new trend is “re-shoring.” There are many reasons why this is a foregone conclusion -- Low domestic energy costs are making it more economical for manufacturers of chemicals, plastics, machinery, and transportation equipment to produce here. Many manufacturers are rethinking the sense of having their R&D teams here while their manufacturing workers are far away. The bull run in commodity prices has ended. The currency gap between the dollar and yuan is narrowing. The transportation expenses of overseas production are at elevated levels. Having a localized supply chain reduces the risks of an overseas natural disaster, port closure, or trade dispute. Most tellingly, wages in China are rising so rapidly that China’s manufacturing cost advantage over the U.S. is projected to shrink to just 5% by 2015. See more about what Matt had to say about the trend toward “re-shoring” in manufacturing companies.

Journal Register News Service A state-of-the-art drilling rig, made primarily for oil and gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas, was designed and constructed by Schramm Inc., a 113-year old company based on the outskirts of West Chester. The 102-foot-tall rig, when fully extended, comes with a $7.65 million price tag. The first T500XD Telemast drill rig was recently sold and will be shipped within a month from Schramm's Virginia Avenue, 14 building, 27-acre property. Not only is the rig so big that it's visible from nearby Henderson High School, but it also "talks" and "walks." Fred Slack, vice president for business development, said the equipment is "designed to walk on a pad site with a full 360 degree motion." Slack said that four hydraulically operated feet will move the apparatus into position, drilling to a depth of 15,000 feet. Slack also said the rig "talks by offering full communication interface connectivity to third party data acquisition" when using the Internet or dedicated satellite communication systems. It has 500,000 pounds of drilling power or hoist capacity. "We are the only company in the state of Pennsylvania to make a rig of this capacity and technology," the vice president said. Steve Hanley, a service technician who has been on the job at Schramm for 39 years, is referred to by his co-workers as "The Schramm-Man." He said that rigs built by Schramm when he started working for the company almost four decades ago had the capacity of just 42,000 pounds, or less than a tenth of Schramm's newest rig. "I never dreamed that we'd build something this big," Hanley said. "I can't describe 500,000 pounds of pull to people." Slack said the rig is "bigger, better, faster, greener and safer" than previous drills. He also said the rig is special since only three employees are required to operate it, rather than six needed for similar structures. The rig also rides from location to location on just eight trucks, less than half the number used by similar devices, saving wear and tear on roadways. It also can be erected without use of a crane. "It's less disruptive to the environment," said Slack. "It's highly portable, it goes into production, does its job and then moves on to the next hole." Slack said Schramm has the capacity to make up to 200 drill rigs per year and can make 10 per year of the company's newest model, which took two years to develop. While 75 percent of the company's revenues are derived from export sales and field service support in more than 80 countries, Schramm grabbed international headlines when drills made in Chester County were used to free 33 miners in a 2010 Chilean mine accident. Serving Chester County, PA ABOUT SCHRAMM, INC. Schramm, Inc. is a century-old Chester County, Pennsylvania manufacturer and global supplier to the hydraulic drill industry, focusing on land based applications. Specializing in mobile, top-head hydraulic rotary drilling rigs, Schramm is a supplier to companies in the energy, mining, geothermal, water well and mine rescue sectors worldwide. Schramm's global reach includes major market positions in China, Chile, Canada, Australia, Russia and South Africa. Schramm has received numerous awards for its world-class manufacturing excellence, superior quality and innovation, significant growth in international business and its ongoing contributions to its local community. Among them, Schramm received the "Manufacturer of the Year Award" from the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in December 2011; the "Business Member of the Year" from the World Trade Center of Greater Philadelphia in May 2010; and the "Chester County Globe Award" from the Chester County Economic Development Council in association with the Pennsylvania Senate and House of Representatives in April 2007.

Next week, the $7.6 million rig will make its way on eight tractor-trailers to Ohio, where its new owner, Alpha Hunter L.L.C., plans to use it to tap into the Marcellus Shale and the deeper Utica Shale formation. Schramm added 50 employees in the last year, mostly engineers, to design the new rig and hopes to make up to 10 of the machines a year. It now employs 235 people. "It creates a whole new business sector for us where we hadn't competed before," said Dave Hartzell, the project manager. For the natural gas industry, Schramm's entry into the big-rig market is important symbolically. The Marcellus Shale Coalition is under the gun to demonstrate to skeptics that the shale boom has economic benefits outside the rural drilling zones. "Schramm, and their world-class drilling rigs, is just one of the many shining examples of how businesses across the entire commonwealth, especially in Southeastern Pennsylvania, are capitalizing on natural gas opportunities," said the coaltion's president, Kathryn Klaber. Schramm, which was founded in 1900 and manufactured air compressors for much of its history, has more than five decades of experience building drill rigs for water wells, geothermal systems, and mineral exploration. About 75 percent of its rigs are exported. A key market is Chile, where its rigs rescued the trapped miners in 2010. Some Marcellus drillers have been using Schramm's smaller rigs to drill the "top holes" that are done before the big directional rigs arrive to thread the more complex horizontal bores into the gas-bearing formation. The new Schramm rig, which can lift 250 tons of pipe and drill more than 15,000 feet deep, is like a traveling carnival ride. The platform, control room, and telescopic mast are assembled on the ground and then lifted as a unit on massive hydraulic cylinders 28 feet into the air. "The speed of mobilization and demobilization is a huge advantage," said Kirk Trosclair, a senior vice president of Alpha Hunter, the company that is buying Rig No. 1. Schramm's promotional literature says the new rig can walk and talk because the entire assembly, weighing 500,000 pounds, can lift itself about six inches off the ground and move, one foot at a time, in any direction. It can travel about 30 feet in an hour. The mobility is an advantage in modern gas development when an operator may drill a dozen or more individual horizontal wells from a single location. The rig "talks" because it includes full satellite communications capability so engineers at headquarters can closely monitor the drilling progress. The new rig is slightly smaller and less powerful than the giant Texas rigs that look like rocket gantries. Schramm is using the smaller size as its selling strength. A Texas rig typically requires 20 trucks to haul and requires six workers to operate, but the Schramm rig can be loaded onto fewer trucks and needs only three workers to operate. The Schramm rig requires fewer workers because the drill pipes are hoisted into place and screwed together automatically, rather than by roughnecks using their hands. It eliminates the need for a pipe rigger to work from a crow's nest 100 feet above the ground, also reducing injuries. "Everything is hands-free and fully automated," said Fred Slack, Schramm's vice president of business development. Contact Andrew Maykuth at 215-854-2947, @Maykuth, or ABOUT SCHRAMM, INC.
