Unlike traditional private equity firms, Heartwood applies a higher-equity, lower-debt approach that is designed to give our portfolio companies the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions and fund capital expansion.

Our transactions are capitalized with roughly half the level of debt typically used in private equity transactions so our companies can thrive in more difficult economic climates or when business challenges arise.

Private equity offers an interesting alternative but, business owners should note that private equity owners are diverse and approach the process of creating value differently.

Most private equity firms that focus on buying family and management-owned companies (including us) prefer to partner with existing owners and management teams (no one knows more about the business, its risks and opportunities after all).

In most situations, the private equity investor buys a controlling interest (greater than 50%) and controls the board of directors going forward, but the existing management team and employees remain in place (and manage the business day-to-day) and the selling owners maintain a minority equity stake.

The most common private equity investment approach has been to try to maximize the use of debt when buying a majority share of a private company and then seeking to increase the size of the company by using operating partners to drive internal growth and make rapid add-on acquisitions.

While less common, some private equity firms, like ours, finance their purchase transactions with a higher level of equity and modest level of debt.  Our multi-decade experience has demonstrated the ability for a private company to expand and create greater value with a moderate level of debt providing the ability to aggressively pursue internal growth avenues and take advantage of add-on acquisitions even in tough economic periods.

While the theory on minimizing a firm’s cost of capital is straight forward enough, in our view it has not been the best way to create equity value in a sustainable fashion.

In our experience, such businesses have been successful in growing by carving out a niche where they can differentiate themselves and add value for their customers.

So, the best thing a private business can do to protect itself against a potentially cautious lender during more difficult times, and improve the prospects of creating equity value, is to grow EBITDA.  The best way to achieve EBITDA growth is to enable the company’s management team to execute on a strategic growth plan with minimal or no interruption (caused by changes in the economy or other unforeseen issues).  In our experience, a key way to achieve this is to moderate the use of debt leverage and structure the company’s capital in a way to maintain strong liquidity.

While cost of capital considerations are important, they should not be made in a vacuum.  A management team’s ability to run the company based on its strengths and to stay true to a strategic plan are key drivers to value creation.  A lower-debt structure is a smart way to support this focus.

We have capital available to make new platform investments in companies with between $5 and $30MM in EBITDA and strategic corporate acquisitions across our portfolio (please find our add-on criteria here).

Such characteristics combined with what is commonly viewed as a “smaller business” (typically EBITDA less than $10 million) has resulted in many cash-flow lenders (the primary lenders to private equity transactions) to only support such companies during relatively good times.

## Additional Investment Information

We seek to identify and close corporate add-on acquisitions for each.

We are actively seeking new platforms and add-on investments.

Fund III continues Capital Partners’ primary strategy of making control equity investments by acquiring small and mid-sized family and management-owned companies in the manufacturing, distribution and service industries.

Consistent with the strategy of prior funds, Fund III focuses on opportunities where it can engage Capital Partners’ experience in actively supporting companies in developing and executing strategic growth plans to build longer-term value and generate quarterly cash yields for investors.

In support of its objectives, Fund III plans to finance its acquisitions with only low-to-moderate levels of outside debt, with most of the capital provided by Fund III, sellers and portfolio management teams primarily in the form of equity.

We look forward to continuing our lower-debt, cash-yielding investment strategy to deliver the strongest returns possible for our Limited Partners and portfolio company management teams.

Our strategy is focused on providing strategic and financial guidance, human resources development, marketing and eCommerce expertise, and operational assistance to support long-term growth, including organic and acquisition-driven expansion into new products, services, and end markets.

Roll-Rite’s management team chose Heartwood Partners over other buyers because of our lower-debt, cash-yielding approach.

To further support management, Heartwood Partners added an experienced board member who was the former CEO of Dayton Parts (a successful Heartwood Partners investment sold in 2012).

Heartwood Partners initiated the adoption of lean manufacturing which resulted in materially improving inventory turns, reducing manufacturing space needs, and meaningfully improving turnaround of customer orders.

As a result of these and other initiatives, management was able to exceed Roll-Rite’s growth goals during Heartwood Partners’ ownership.

John Willert, Managing Director at Capital Partners

URL: https://heartwoodpartners.com/the-importance-of-integration-in-an-add-on-acquisition-strategy TITLE: The Importance of Integration in an Add-on Acquisition Strategy - Heartwood Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ A critical element of our strategy as investment partners is to help the companies in our portfolio grow through strategic , add-on acquisition.  Add-on acquisitions can bring many opportunities for a business to grow from additional product or service offerings, access to new markets, stronger market positioning, valuable economies of scale, more efficient utilization of capital assets, , and more.    In order to realize these benefits, the acquiring business and the acquired company need to integrate. “Integration” is combining two organizations to leverage people, process, markets, assets, technology, and more to generate more value together than they did separately.  Essentially, Integration is the work to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Integration can be difficult.  Even when the two companies are well aligned, have strong recognition of one another’s strengths and shortcomings, and share a vision of a combined go-to-market strategy, , integration can be challenging.    Integration brings together two companies that often do things differently, have different cultures, operate different processes and systems, manage customers differently, organize roles and responsibilities differently.  Integration also commonly means bringing together owners and founders of two successful businesses with great track records who are accustomed to running their business independently. The good news is the integration road is well traveled.  Lessons of critical priorities and best practices are known.  We bring deep experience partnering with management teams through the integration process to successfully realize strategic and financial rewards of growth.  Our integration approach leverages a playbook developed through experience and customized to founder and/or management-owned businesses.  Business owners who partner with Heartwood Partners benefit from this tailored approach.  Key priorities of our integration playbook include: Strategic Alignment Communication Collaborative Planning Integration Competency Strategic Alignment – Strategic alignment is the driving force behind add-on acquisitions.  The purpose of the acquisition is to create growth opportunities for both the acquiring platform business as well as the acquired target.  The strategic plan is front and center in our integration playbook.  We evaluate many questions and design considerations through the lens of the strategy that originally brought the businesses together.  We begin with the go-to-market strategy to map the value proposition each company brings to the combined business.  We then organize integration priorities to support this mutual value proposition.  It is simple in concept, but implementing it in a manner that leverages joint strengths without burdening the business with unfavorable headwinds is honed tradecraft. Communication – Growing through acquisition induces change in many aspects of a business, especially for small and medium sized companies.  It is even more impactful in founder-led businesses where there has been a long history of independent operations.  In this environment an acquisition can be overwhelming.  We help our owner-partners and their teams manage through proactive and transparent communication.  Before a deal closes, we actively engage stakeholders on all sides to build communication plans addressing concerns and constituents.  The plan includes near-term, medium-term, and long-term communication with employees, customers, suppliers, and other important business partners.  Communication priorities address the exciting opportunities that come with growth as well as challenging topics likely to create anxiety.  Transparent and recurring communication relieves stress and builds alignment.  Another important benefit is that the work to develop the communication plan requires detail vetting of the integration strategy and teamwork among the leaders across both companies.  It enables early identification and resolution of issues, fostering strong working relationships that will be a significant benefit as the team faces challenges throughout the integration process. Collaborative Planning – When two companies come together through acquisition many things can get in the way of achieving the original strategy.  In the end, the most significant factor of whether integration is  successful or not comes down to how well the leaders and teams of both companies work together.  Teams can overcome drastic differences in culture, strategy, organization, and business process if the leaders are able to work effectively with one another.  Our integration playbook emphasizes the importance of collaboration across companies and teams early in the process.   An example is our playbook itself.  The playbook is employed as a framework outlining key areas of focus, but it does not prescribe outcomes or actions.  Instead, we engage with the leadership team in both companies, reviewing the integration framework and work side by side to build the detailed integration plans, phasing, and responsibilities together.  In this way, creating the plan is one of the first steps in collaboration.   The plan is the team’s plan, not Heartwood Partners’ plan.  Ownership of the plan and the outcomes is with the team.  Each team member is accountable for his/her commitments to the plan.  This teamwork and accountability to one another is the basis for collaborative success as the team works through difficulties along the way. Integration Competency – Legacy is critically important to Heartwood Partners.  One of our most important legacies is the success of our companies long after they successfully exit the Heartwood portfolio.   Among the many investments we make towards the long-term success of our companies, one of the most important is helping the senior management team develop the ability to manage acquisition integrations as a core competency.  It is very common that leaders of our companies have little or no experience managing large-scale change programs such as acquisition.  A central theme of our playbook is to support and empower the management team to learn and lead the integration process.  Developing integration management as a core competency is valuable to Heartwood as the team may need to succeed with multiple integrations during our ownership period.  Equally, the demonstrated capability of the management team to successfully lead integration contributes to exit valuation and creates leadership opportunities in the future.  Our goal is for leaders of our companies to become self-sufficient in managing large, complex business integrations while we work with them. We keep these principles and priorities as top integration best practices.  Doing this is a critical part of our partnership with management teams.   Successful integration means the companies achieved strategic and tactical benefits together that neither could have achieved separately.  The combined enterprise strengthens returns and enhances value at exit, driving significant shareholder value.

Given the success of some of the companies we have partnered with in the past, it should come as no surprise that Heartwood Partners has been hard at work identifying and pursuing recycling and environmental services companies with strong tailwinds and good macros.  We closed on a new investment in a high-growth specialty waste/recycling sector that we anticipate announcing in 2022. The founders/management team of this company were not actively looking for outside growth capital when we initially approached them, and they had said “no” to a number of other private equity firms and investment banks over the years. What set Heartwood Partners apart? Our investment team’s deep experience in the environmental services / recycling sector, our singular focus and partnership approach to working with family / founder owned businesses and importantly our current cash-yield / low leverage strategy that struck them as a unique in a crowded market. The core elements of our shared vision include investing in people / “new seats” to scale, formal strategic planning, growth capex to add more processing capacity at their Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permitted facility and a robust add-on strategy, which is already well on its way, please find our criteria below.

Patten Seed Company completed its second add-on acquisition since Heartwood Partners’ initial investment and expanded its sod-growing footprint westward by purchased Frog Pond Turf in December 2021.
