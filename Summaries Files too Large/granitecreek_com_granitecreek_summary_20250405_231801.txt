In an onerous sector for private equity, Granite Creek sees chance to gain an edge

Granite Creek Capital Partners Announces Investment in CP Direct

We talk about finding companies to invest in or buy that are ‘needs to have, not wants to have,’

The companies we have invested in are foundational and fundamental. Because they are not discretionary items, that gives us confidence to continue to make these investments, knowing that they have a very highly relevant place in their markets.

Opportunities for strategic growth and acquisitions continue to remain at the forefront of our business approach.

“We’re not going to let timing stand in the way of making a good business decision,”

Lehman said Granite Creek doesn’t have any imminent plans to exit DBW. Farrell and Lehman agreed that a typical five-to-seven-year holding period is not a requirement for the company and its ownership tenure will be flexible.

Granite Creek Capital Partners, L.L.C., a private investment firm based in Chicago, in partnership with Knox Capital Holdings, LLC, today announced an investment in Bundle, a national provider of compliant real estate document preparation services, to support its acquisition of Rosenberg LPA LLC (RLPA), a similarly focused company that has serviced title companies and lenders for over 15 years.

The investment team plays an active role with the leadership of its portfolio companies to support growth, strategy and financial development.

Granite Creek’s investment will provide the added support for CP Direct to continue building a comprehensive direct mail services and corporate communications platform.

We look forward to working with the CP Direct team to continue investing in the business’ breadth of services and capabilities.

The growth capital investment from Granite Creek will help us to further expand the business both organically and inorganically.

Granite Creek is frequently the first institutional investor in a company, helping position the company for greater access to capital markets when needed.

Our team’s operational and financial guidance is highly valued by the companies in which we invest and is the key ingredient to the strong absolute and risk-adjusted returns that we seek.

Granite Creek portfolio company, DCG, a federal government consulting firm, recently launched their newest joint venture, Avvy Insights, with their partners Arillic.

We have been impressed by their methodical implementation of operational improvements and growth initiatives at DBW, and are confident in their ability to drive further value creation at Peak.,” said Ken Kruger, Director at Granite Creek.

The acquisition of iTek Graphics by Salem One was funded by investments from Granite Creek’s FlexCap III fund along with a co-investment from Patriot Capital.

Flexibility is just one lesson co-founder Mark Radzik says he learned during his time in legendary billionaire investor Sam Zell’s office.

Beyond that, though, flexibility has been Granite Creek’s guiding strategy since its launch in 2005. That means being open to a variety of investment options in a wide array of businesses.

Its willingness to take minority stakes and provide loans is resonating at a time when many private equity deals are foundering in the abyss of valuation gaps.

The firm’s chief business is to capitalize on business owners who are reluctant to sell outright by making minority investments or private debt placements. It will serve as a mezzanine lender or senior debt provider.

Nonetheless, it has found most of its success in making a combination of minority investments and loans to target companies.

We think there are a lot of interesting small and midsize businesses in those subsectors that are offering innovative products and services that can be highly relevant to the large integrated farmers and livestock producers.

Clark has said personal relationships are key to doing agribusiness deals since the sector is dominated by family-owned businesses.

Andrew joined Granite Creek in early 2021 and quickly established himself as an astute and influential deal team member. In his first year with the firm, Andrew was instrumental in closing two new platform investments and seamlessly took on portfolio monitoring responsibilities for the firm’s two medical device investments. “We were excited to welcome Andrew aboard and he hit the ground running,” remarked Mark Radzik Partner at Granite Creek. “Andrew came with principal investment experience and used his familiarity with the transaction process and analytical skill set to show he was ready for advancement at the firm.” Since joining, Andrew has played a meaningful role in Granite Creek’s investments in Big Easy Blends and C&C Manufacturing. In both instances, he distinguished himself by quickly understanding the key business drivers and how projected market conditions would impact performance. Moreover, Andrew leveraged this knowledge to build relationships with the portfolio companies and be a thought partner to the businesses as they evaluated strategic considerations. “Starting during diligence and continuing post-close, Andrew has been a great partner to the finance and accounting team at Big Easy.” commented Craig Cordes, CFO at Big Easy Blends. “Andrew helped think through and organize our business planning process and then worked with us to build out a robust budgeting and forecasting model that helps provide business insights to the rest of the operating team. We congratulate Andrew on his well-deserved promotion and look forward to working with him on future strategic projects.” As a member of the investment team, Andrew is responsible for deal screening, transaction execution and portfolio management. Prior to Granite Creek, he was an Associate at Bain Capital Credit, where he was responsible for evaluating and monitoring investments in leveraged loans and high yield bonds, primarily in the technology sector. He holds a B.B.A. in Finance from the University of Notre Dame. DOWNLOAD PDF RETURN TO NEWS

Ritchie, which was founded in 1929, had been employee-owned since 2004. The Conrad, Iowa-based company, with 70 employees, is a mainstay of the industry. “If you are running a cow calf operation or a small dairy, you know that this brand has … resonance,” Jim Clark, a partner at Granite Creek, said in an interview with Crain’s. “They make a high-quality product that is reliable. They always are looking to innovate.” Chicago-based Granite Creek has been on an acquisition spree in the agribusiness space, making three deals in the past three months despite an overall slowdown in the sector. Sluggish commodity prices and uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration’s impact on the farm economy have cooled the dealmaking environment. The total value of private-equity agribusiness deals fell to $1.56 billion last year through mid-August, from $3.04 billion in the same period of 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The number of announced deals during that period decreased to 114 from 158. But Granite Creek is buying companies that are making products farmers or ranches need if they want to stay afloat, which alleviates concerns about overall trends in the marketplace. “We talk about finding companies to invest in or buy that are ‘needs to have, not wants to have,’” Clark said. “The companies we have invested in are foundational and fundamental. Because they are not discretionary items, that gives us confidence to continue to make these investments, knowing that they have a very highly relevant place in their markets.” The deal for Ritchie, which stemmed from the company putting itself on the market, took about six months to close, Clark said. Financial terms were not released. Clark said the investment was similar in size to the cost of other Granite Creek acquisitions. Last month, the firm took a stake in Gurnee-based Seedbox for less than $50 million. Rural American Fund, a private-equity fund, provided additional money for the deal and Ritchie’s management and employees also put up some funds in a rollover investment. Granite Creek is keeping Ritchie’s management team in place. The investment will be used to expand the company’s share in its core markets, expand geographic coverage and grow its product portfolio in the horse industry. Granite Creek has been making agribusiness deals for about a decade. Clark has said the sector is a niche that does not have the kind of attention from private-equity firms that other parts of the economy do. The private-equity firm, which also plays in the manufacturing, business services and health care space, is focused on companies that are already generating revenue and have annual EBITDA of less than $10 million a year.

Ideal targets would help expand the product line of the Vernon Hills, Illinois-based company into wood, composites, food and beverage, carpeting and flooring and other end markets, the executive told Mergermarket. DBW, which generated around USD 100m in revenue in 2023, acquired diamond and carbide precision cutting tool manufacturer and servicer Peak Toolworks in December from Audax Private Equity. The company also acquired specialty core bits supplier 4CoreBiz in September 2022. Terms for both deals were undisclosed. With 12 service centers, Peak represented a sizeable acquisition for DBW, Farrell said. The company could acquire targets of a similar size, or smaller tuck-ins like 4CoreBiz, he noted, declining to disclose specific financial figures. Farrell said DBW would consider deals on an opportunistic basis after it makes operational improvements to Peak. However, Peter Lehman, co-founder and partner at Granite Creek, said DBW could acquire targets sooner. “We’re not going to let timing stand in the way of making a good business decision,” Lehman said in a joint interview with Farrell. DBW will focus on supplying and distribution, but long-term plans could include bringing more manufacturing in house either organically or via acquisitions, Farrell said. Founded in 1987, DBW sells blades, core bits and cup wheels used to cut building materials such as concrete, asphalt, granite, tile and marble. Following the acquisition of Peak, DBW has 15 locations throughout the US and Canada. Granite Creek and Canterbury acquired DBW in June 2021. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that Granite Creek acquired a very large minority stake in the company for USD 14m. Canterbury, which is owned by Farrell and his father, the former CEO of Illinois Tool Works W. James Farrell, also acquired a stake in the business for an undisclosed sum. Together, Granite Creek and Canterbury constitute a controlling interest in the company, Farrell and Lehman said. Lehman said Granite Creek doesn’t have any imminent plans to exit DBW. Farrell and Lehman agreed that a typical five-to-seven-year holding period is not a requirement for the company and its ownership tenure will be flexible. DBW has around 400 employees following the Peak acquisition, according to Farrell. Weis & Burney provide legal services to DBW, while accounting and tax due diligence is provided by CohnReznick. Legal services providers for Granite Creek include Goldberg Kohn. Future tax and accounting services for DBW will be provided by Miller Cooper.

URL: https://granitecreek.com/news/granite-creek-pinstripes-polish-bowling-technique TITLE: Granite Creek, Pinstripes Polish Bowling Technique - Granite Creek Capital Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Media Coverage, Portfolio Update Granite Creek, Pinstripes Polish Bowling Technique PINSTRIPES JUNE 06, 2023 By Chris Nolter June 05, 2023 03:34 PM Chicago middle-market firm Granite Creek Capital Partners LLC is backing Pinstripes Inc. founder Dale Schwartz’s plan to bring bowling, bocce ball and Italian American cuisine to malls and other locales throughout America. “I’ve watched what Dale has done when he created a family entertainment concept built around high-quality food as well as a fun gaming opportunity,” said Granite Creek co-founder and partner Brian Boorstein, who has been friends with Schwartz for 40 years. Though pickleball is coming up fast on its heels, bowling is the largest participatory sport in the U.S., with about 69 million people hitting the lanes each year, according to the U.S. Bowling Congress.Amid thousands of U.S. bowling alleys, private companies such as Pinstripes blend upscale dining with what was historically a blue-collar pastime. Meanwhile, Bowlero Corp. (BOWL) has rolled up peers, and entertainment and dining chain Dave & Buster’s Entertainment Inc. (PLAY) bought a spot on the lanes, providing a pair of large, public consolidators as bowling raises its profile. The Three B’s Founded in 2006, Pinstripes has 13 locations and plans for six more under the tag line “Bowling, Bocce and Bistro.” Schwartz added bocce to the mix because “it married up with the Italian American flair of food,” Boorstein said. From its initial location in Chicago, Pinstripes has expanded through the Midwest to California; Texas; Washington, D.C.; and Connecticut. “Broadly speaking, there’s probably room and attractive locations for 150 Pinstripes or maybe more,” Boorstein said. Because of the specific mix of entertainment and cuisine, Pinstripes is taking a build-rather-than-buy strategy. Targets abound, but a generic bowling alley would not fit the Italian American theme. “This is all organic growth,” said Boorstein, who touted the company’s ability to launch new locations. “They have such a well-trained staff that they not only can be successful at any one location, but it is equally as successful and replicable across multiple locations all across the United States,” he said. Pinstripes doesn’t disclose finances, though Granite Creek typically invests $10 million to $30 million in companies generating $3 million to $15 million in Ebitda from $25 million to $100 million in sales, with grows profit margins above 30%. The company’s ability to weather the pandemic lockdowns was a selling point, Boorstein said. So was Pinstripe’s appeal to mall owners who are eager to lure foot traffic and brick-and-mortar shoppers. Bowling centers takes up a lot of square footage and attract multiple generations, Boorstein said. “Grandparents, parents, kids, young kids, which not only keeps it fresh, it fills up the locations throughout the day at different times,” he said. “When the mall owners see someone that has an attractive place with good clientele at many points throughout the day, it’s a real win,” he said. Bowling for Buyouts Though Pinstripes may not be an acquirer, M&A will be part of bowling’s storyline. “Bowling is a highly fragmented industry with approximately 3,500 independent operators in the U.S. alone, which represents an attractive consolidation opportunity to drive further growth,” Oppenheimer & Co. analysts Ian Zaffino and Isaac Sellhausen wrote in their October 2022 report initiating coverage of Bowlero. Richmond, Va.-based Bowlero is the lead consolidator. The company struck its latest deal on Wednesday, with the $90 million purchase of upscale lane operator Lucky Strike Entertainment LLC. Lucky Strike’s 14 bowling centers will put Bowlero’s portfolio at 343 centers in 35 states. Rival entertainment and dining group Dave & Buster’s bought Main Event Entertainment Inc., which operates 50 bowling centers in 17 states, for $835 million in June 2022. The purchase of Main Event from from Ardent Leisure Group Ltd. and RedBird Capital Partners LLC was not a mere bolt-on. Main Event boss Chris Morris became CEO of Dave & Buster’s following the transaction. With Lucky Strike and Pinstripes announcing deals on Wednesday, Louisville, Ky.-based Executive Strike & Spare Inc. is one of the larger remaining independents with 25 centers. Other U.S. alleys include Flamingo Bowl Inc. of McAllen, Texas; Ten Pin Ally of Hilliard, Ohio; and Grawn, Mich.-based Incredible Mo’s. Overseas bowlers can frequent Bowling Van Gogh in France, the U.K.’s Hollywood Bowl Group plc and Round One Corp. of Japan. Bowling’s universal appeal cuts across borders, age groups and athletic ability, Boorstein said, and underpins Granit Creek’s thesis for Pinstripe. “All of us grew up bowling and you’ve got this good feeling in your heart, your mind about the times that you went bowling with your friends as a kid, or went to birthday parties,” he said. “Dale wanted to do that and to take it up a notch with a more elegant setting.” DOWNLOAD PDF RETURN TO NEWS Related News Granite Creek Capital Partners Announces Investment in Pinstripes, Inc.

URL: https://granitecreek.com/news/granite-creek-stays-flexible-with-300m-fund TITLE: Granite Creek Stays Flexible With $300M Fund - Granite Creek Capital Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Media Coverage Granite Creek Stays Flexible With $300M Fund FEBRUARY 19, 2024 Source: Mergers & Acquisitions, By Paul Elias Control buyouts, minority interest investments or debt placements, Chicago-based Granite Creek is ready to invest. Flexibility is just one lesson co-founder Mark Radzik says he learned during his time in legendary billionaire investor Sam Zell’s office. He tells us more. Granite Creek typically insists on being the first institutional investor in a business. Beyond that, though, flexibility has been Granite Creek’s guiding strategy since its launch in 2005. That means being open to a variety of investment options in a wide array of businesses. Its willingness to take minority stakes and provide loans is resonating at a time when many private equity deals are foundering in the abyss of valuation gaps. It also has two specialized real estate arms, Renovo and Moraine Farmland Partners. Renovo provides residential real estate loans and Moraine buys and manages Midwest farms. The firm’s chief business is to capitalize on business owners who are reluctant to sell outright by making minority investments or private debt placements. It will serve as a mezzanine lender or senior debt provider. That doesn’t mean it won’t buy out an owner. Granite Creek in November acquired NYP Corp., a New Jersey nursery packager and distributor. Nonetheless, it has found most of its success in making a combination of minority investments and loans to target companies. “Entrepreneurs like the debt because they don’t have to take dilution,” Radzik says. “I really think ’24 is going to be an active year for non-control investments and private credit.” Granite Creek usually invests between $10 million and $30 million in each transaction. It targets companies with $25 million to $100 million in revenue and Ebitda between $3 million and $15 million. Granite Creek closed its third fund in November — oversubscribed $300 million FlexCap III — which the firm already put to work investing in two lower-middle-market companies: commercial printer Salem One and bowling alley entertainment centers operator Pinstripes. Salem One used its capital infusion to expand operations with the February acquisition of printing company iTek Graphics. The two new investments out of the new fund join 14 other current investments that range from pre-mixed, frozen alcohol drink maker Big Easy Blends to Life Spine, a medical device maker. It took a little more than a year of lobbying existing LPs to return and wooing new investors from university endowments, pension plans and insurance companies among other sources to raise its third fund after raising $200 million for FlexCap II, which closed in 2019. Radzik says the firm was fortunate to start and finish fundraising right before the market turned. “We did a lot of work in 2022,” he says. “We also had good results,” Radzik says with a chuckle of Midwest understatement, where he has spent his entire adult life. “I think that helps.” Radzik, an Indiana University undergrad and business school graduate who has spent his professional career in Chicago, co-founded Granite Creek in 2005 after working his way up to managing director of Zell’s Equity Group Investment. “He was more than a mentor to me,” he says of Zell. “I learned so much from him. “The way he thought, how he made decisions.” Radzik says Zell inspired and motivated him to set up his own shop. Zell died last May at age 81. “Many great lessons and sayings I learned from Sam pop up all the time in my life, ” Radzik says. VIEW FULL ARTICLE RETURN TO NEWS

Amarillo, Texas,-based Global Animal Products has customers in the U.S., Mexico, Australia, South Africa, Costa Rica and Brazil. “Anywhere there are beef livestock herds, they are a relevant product,” Clark said. “We viewed that as a great foundation and something which we could build further upon as they build up more market share and introduce additional novel products.” Global Animal Products Chief Executive Officer Ben Tarr will remain in his role. Company founder Ken Ridenour will serve on the board of directors but step back from active management. As part of the deal, Granite Creek will periodically sell a portion of its stake to Global Animal Products employees. Timing of the sales will depend on company performance, Clark said. The private-equity firm is focused on acquiring companies that are already generating revenue and have annual EBITDA of less than $10 million a year. Clark said the agribusiness industry is a niche that does not have the kind of attention from private-equity sectors of the economy like energy and health care do. Granite Creek’s current investments in the space include Moraine Farmland Partners, a fund it formed in 2020 with agribusiness executive Jim Zimmer that purchases and manages farmland in the Midwest, and NYP, a company it bought in 2023 that makes specialized bags and containers to transport plants and trees from farms to nurseries to homes. The Chicago-based private equity firm also recently funded the acquisition of Diamond Animal Health through Veterinary Pharmaceutical Solutions, one of its portfolio companies it bought in 2020. Diamond researches and manufactures animal vaccines and drugs. Clark has said personal relationships are key to doing agribusiness deals since the sector is dominated by family-owned businesses. The Global Animal Products was no exception, as Granite Creek operating partner Mike Ray has known Ridenour since college. VIEW FULL ARTICLE RETURN TO NEWS

Direct mail marketing continues to draw private equity investment as more businesses integrate the time tested channel into advertising strategies. Monomoy Capital Partners LP, for instance, is the latest entrant to bet on the fragmented category with its June portfolio addition of the 116-year-old direct mailing business Japs-Olson Co. “There is this common misconception that direct mail is a dying channel and that it’s not as effective but that’s just not the case,” Monomoy partner and head of investment team Jaime Forsyth told The Deal. “Direct mail has the highest return on investment of any direct to consumer marketing channel and is very important in conjunction with digital marketing in an omnichannel approach.” As consumer audiences moved into digital formats over the years, businesses naturally shifted their budgets toward online marketing, according to Kroll managing director Jacob Rapp. But specialized direct mail campaigns have a proven history of offering meaningful return on investment when used in conjunction with digital marketing tools. Businesses are using tools such as QR codes and personalized URLs in direct mail, both to bring customers to their websites and to track customer behavior for targeted marketing. Direct mail marketing can range from a simple postcard with a QR code for discounted grocery delivery to a perfume catalog, with samples, that includes a discount code for online checkout. “The effectiveness of a direct mail campaign, or any sort of direct marketing strategy, depends on the quality of the data that you’re using to develop target lists,” Rapp said. “So if you can develop smart tools to target households through physical mail and link those to consumer identities in digital environments, that’s where direct mail is more and more effective.” Monomoy too plans to invest in data and analytics to help Japs-Olson tap new customers, increase customer wallet share and develop new products. The firm will also build out finance operations and invest in equipment and digital capabilities to boost production capacity in the company’s existing footprint. Japs-Olson makes over one billion personalized direct mailers such as booklets and popups annually. The platform’s clients include Fortune 500 companies in industries including financial services, insurance, healthcare and large nonprofits, among others. The company, which has over 600 employees and a 704,000 square-foot facility outside of Minneapolis, ships the mailers either to its clients or mails them directly to households. Backed by Numbers Direct mail has an open rate of 90% among consumers according to Data and Marketing Association, now part the Association of National Advertisers, or ANA. Email marketing has an open rate of just 21.3% per Mailchimp data. In a 2022 survey by ANA, marketers who sent letter-sized envelopes to prospective customers through direct mail reported the highest return on investment out of all marketing channels at 43% in 2021. Even age groups typically viewed as digital-first engage with direct mail, data shows. About 47% of millennials surveyed by the United States Postal Service over six months between mid-2020 and early 2021, went to a company’s website based on information in a direct mailer while 27% made a purchase. Millennials, the largest adult population in the U.S., were in fact more likely than any other generation to take an action . They also have the highest awareness of, and interest in, digitally enhanced mailers that include QR Codes and personalized links, the report said. Its no surprise then that half of the businesses that responded to ANA’s aforementioned survey said they were planning to increase their spend on direct mail marketing over the course of 2022. “ Research has shown that direct mail is not only effective for older generations, but it’s actually highly effective for younger generations too. It’s one of the positive trends that we think makes this market highly resilient.” JORDAN LISS, DIRECTOR AT GRANITE CREEK See below for full article. DOWNLOAD PDF RETURN TO NEWS

This unique and proprietary technology was engineered, specifically, to offer an advanced solution for bone grafting procedures. Royal Biologics announces the launch in conjunction with their licensing agreement of Molecular Matrix’s patented underlying their Osteo-P® BGS technology. BIO-REIGN 3D™ provides the ideal microenvironment for cell proliferation and vascularization leading to regeneration of healthy bone. BIO-REIGN 3D™ was designed to form a robust and highly porous bone graft substitute. BIO-REIGN 3D™ is radiolucent upon implantation and becomes radiopaque as the boney healing occurs which enables visualization of real-time healing. Bio-Reign 3D™ provides a physical interconnected and highly porous matrix that supports osteogenic cellular infiltration leading to new bone growth.

BIO-REIGN 3D™ BGS can additionally be sutured in place to prevent graft migration. “ “Numerous natural and synthetic biomaterials have been proposed as 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering, including collagen, hyaluronic acid, decellularized extracellular matrices, polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid … However, the ideal material must be biocompatible, biodegradable, bioabsorbable, nontoxic and noninflammatory. Bio-Reign 3D™ is the final result of this ideal 3D scaffold.” CHARLES LEE CEO OF MOLECULAR MATRIX “We are thrilled with our announcement of our licensing of Molecular Matrix’s patented Osteo-P® BGS technology and U.S. Commercial Launch of BIO-REIGN 3D™. Launching the industry’s first Organic/Natural hyper-crosslinked carbohydrate polymer bone graft filler presents a new and novel technology for Advanced Synthetics in Orthopedics.

Royal Biologics, an ortho-biologics company specializing in the research and advancement of autologous and live cellular solutions, today announced the completed acquisition of FIBRINET, from Vertical Spine LLC. The acquisition comes as part of Royal Biologics’ strategic initiative to add novel technologies to its growing portfolio of autologous and live cellular solutions to support orthopedic and spinal fusion. The FIBRINET system utilizes a patient’s own autologous blood to create a platelet-rich fibrin matrix/membrane (PRFM). During this process, a patient’s autologous platelets are harvested first through centrifugation and then combined with a proprietary solution to solidify into a fibrin clot/membrane. PRFM can be used to help augment spinal fusions and provide surgeons a new and novel biologic option. FIBRINET is the first commercialized system that utilizes a non-thrombin solution to create a reproducible platelet-rich fibrin matrix. The use of its proprietary solution to solidify a fibrin membrane provides the unique advantage of creating a biologic reservoir of growth factors and stem cells that can be held and used at the point of care for spinal fusion.

When speaking with Stephen Izzo, Owner of Zonatherm and Granite Creek Executive Council Member, he stated that if you are looking to build a successful business, “above all else, build an employee-centric culture.” The firm prides itself on fostering an employee-focused culture with exceptional work-life balance. But more than that, Zonatherm offers employees a share in the company’s success. When you take care of your employees and provide them with significant benefits and opportunities, you then have an employee base of motivated, happy, and fulfilled individuals. Izzo has seen firsthand how happy employees have made a direct impact on the success of the company and explained that “our mission of being a great place to work with top-notch employees has directly led to more satisfied customers, leading to more business.”  Izzo goes on to explain that many aspects drive a firm’s culture, and the processes you put in place to maintain and oversee these factors are what can truly set your company apart. Two Key Drivers to a Successful Company Culture: Implement a systemic process for hiring When implementing procedures for hiring, make sure to be in the business of behavior selection rather than behavior modification. Selecting people with the right mindset and personality for the job will have lasting effects on both their work product as well as the firm as a whole. Provide a path to success in employees’ careers Providing employees with avenues toward personal growth, when done in a way that is financially stable for the company, can lead to lasting, tangible company achievements. Examples include promoting from within, setting up meaningful profit-sharing incentives, and offering access to continued learning and development.

Internships are a cornerstone of finance careers, offering students a way to get technical training and hands-on job experience, access mentorship and make industry connections. This summer, however, saw a decline in the number of available internships, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, which reported a 7% drop in internship listings on Handshake, a job search platform for college students. Bloomberg attributed the trend to cutbacks in entry-level hiring and the resources required to support internship programs. Regardless, some middle-market firms are doubling down on internships as a source of talent and as a way to introduce students to new career paths. Monomoy Capital Partners is among them. Since launching its internship program in 2021, the private equity firm has welcomed four interns—two rising college seniors and two rising juniors—each summer for its 10-week program. Interns go through the same onboarding experience as a full-time Monomoy hire, including meeting with senior leaders to learn about the firm and its approach to investing. During the program, they receive training on communications and technical skills, work on a deal, visit a portfolio company and attend a board meeting, among other activities. Richa Kumar, a rising senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in finance and entrepreneurship, started her summer internship at Monomoy with the goal of developing her technical skills as well as an investor mindset. “Being able to really sit in on these live deals and see from start to finish how the people above me are thinking about these companies, the things that stand out to them, and just picking up on recurring themes” are aspects of the internship that have been particularly valuable, she says. Kumar previously interned at an early-stage investment firm, and she notes that the experience at Monomoy offered exposure to a private equity work environment. “While I was a bit hesitant about finance going into this experience, because it is largely different than venture capital and the culture in that realm, I definitely am excited to pursue a path in private equity and in the financial services industry more generally,” she says. “Monomoy has definitely played a huge role in that thought process.” A PIPELINE OF TALENT One of Monomoy’s goals in designing its internship program was to establish a robust, analyst-focused agenda, giving the firm a foundation to access a broad talent pool. “Our approach invites the highest-achieving and most diverse group of students to be considered for our program, and better yet, engages students early enough in the process that Monomoy can compete with investment banks and other firms that traditionally recruit right out of undergrad,” says Emily Kane, Monomoy’s managing director of talent. The firm has hired several former interns full-time. One of the first interns from the inaugural class was just promoted to associate after two years of the analyst program, according to Kane. Two current Monomoy analysts came from the second intern class, and two other former interns will join the firm in the coming months. Capitala Group also views its internship program as a pipeline for talent. Each summer, the private equity and private credit provider brings on two or three interns, typically sophomores and rising juniors, says Capitala Vice President Alex Pruitt. The internship includes initial training and exposure to the firm’s relationship with its portfolio companies, evaluating new investments and sitting in on calls with investment banks, and transaction modeling. That all culminates in a final case study, where the interns apply what they’ve learned from the summer. A goal of Capitala’s 10-week program is to prepare students for investment banking internships, Pruitt says. “We try to give them as much experience as possible during their sophomore summer so that they’re well prepared the following summer in investment banking, and ultimately, for the first job as an analyst in investment banking.” The hope is that after several years working elsewhere, former interns will return to Capitala. Pruitt estimates that four of Capitala’s current employees were once interns, including himself. OPENING DOORS Some firms expressly aim to promote diversity and inclusion through their internship programs. After Chihiro Bacon applied to an internship at Granite Creek Capital Partners, the Chicago-based investment firm connected her with the Small Business Investing Scholars Program, which Avante Capital Partners launched in 2019 to promote gender, racial and ethnic diversity within private equity. The program brings together participants virtually several times a week, Bacon says, where they hear from industry leaders and learn about private equity and the Small Business Administration. Meanwhile, as an intern on the investment track at Granite Creek, Bacon participates in staff meetings and interacts with portfolio companies and prospective investments. Peter Lehman, partner and co-founder of Granite Creek, describes his firm’s “open book” approach to the internship program, in which students gain exposure to every level of the business.

The barriers to entry to build a food and beverage brand are lower than ever Gone are the days of limited access to consumers through traditional advertising methods. The ubiquity of social media has given rise to a new generation of brands that have immediate access to consumers at a fraction of the cost. Brands like Olipop have reached over $200MM in annual sales using TikTok as a primary method to build brand love. As high-growth brands continue to perform, many retailers are beginning to take more risks on founder-led businesses. However, as these businesses continue to build on their foundations, meaningful access to capital is critical to achieve sustained growth. Mr. Sexson forecasts a continued rise in early-stage, high-growth brands tapping into private capital to fund and maintain scale. Firms that can provide flexible capital options that enable operational expansion will win. Private equity firms are requiring an extra level of due diligence During Covid, we witnessed empty grocery shelves due to supply chain disruptions followed by significant price increases. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the cost of store-bought food increased by 23.5 percent from February 2020 to May 2023. That level of price disruption is significant and many brands did not survive. As we head into 2024, inflationary pressures will likely remain elevated vs. pre-pandemic levels. With a hopeful fall in interest rates in 2024, we are likely to see a rebound in food and beverage M&A transactions. As firms evaluate new deals, an extra level of due diligence needs to be given to price elasticities and supply chain efficiencies. Emerging brands in food and beverage that choose to more closely integrate their operations and supply chain will be in a stronger position to withstand disruptions. About Cory Sexson Granite Creek Executive Council Member Cory Sexson is a seasoned CPG/Food & Beverage Executive with over 15 years of transformative leadership in multinational corporations like PepsiCo & Tyson Foods, and private equity-backed ventures like Tropicana Brands Group.

In February 2020, Granite Creek and its Operating Partner, Mike Ray led the control buyout of VPS from its four founders.  The firm arranged the senior and junior subordinated debt for the transaction as well as funded the equity along with a rollover from the original founders.  Our investment was used to provide liquidity for the founders and to invest in the go forward growth of the business.  Key investments were made in human capital, the facility and in research & development initiatives for organic growth.  Subsequently, Granite Creek supported the acquisition of Diamond Animal Health (DAH) by supporting the expansion of the senior debt facility and providing a follow-on equity investment to close the transaction.  With the addition of DAH, VSH’s management team was able to enter new end-markets, add new product lines, leverage expanded production capabilities and achieve greater economies of scale across its core operational functions.

In January 2019, Granite Creek completed a $15 million non-control investment split between a subordinated debt security and a minority equity stake. Granite Creek’s investment was used to refinance existing seller notes and provide working capital to scale Morrow’s already outstanding executive team and execute acquisitions. By splitting Granite Creek’s investment between debt and equity, the company received the capital it needed while allowing Morrow’s management team to maintain a controlling position in the Company.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In January 2022, during a scheduled marketing call between firms, Granite Creek pitched TPG Growth on an investment in Morrow Sodali.  Three months later, TPG Growth successfully acquired a majority interest in Morrow Sodali.  Today, Granite Creek retains a minority interest and serves on the company’s Board of Directors.
