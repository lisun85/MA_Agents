# INVESTMENT STRATEGY, APPROACH & CRITERIA

## Investment Approach & Philosophy

RLJ Equity Partners is a middle-market private equity firm focused on generating long-term capital appreciation by investing in profitable and growing businesses led by exceptional management teams.

RLJ invests in traditional buy-outs, recapitalizations, growth equity infusions, and add-on acquisitions

We seek opportunities where we are able to partner with proven and motivated management teams to create value through a combination of strategic capital and operational insight

RLJ Equity Partners is a middle-market private equity firm focused on generating long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies with strong management teams and sustainable competitive advantages.

We look for established companies with a proven track record of success and a clear path to future growth.

Our commitment to partnerships, deep industry knowledge, operational resources, and strategic alliances differentiate us from other middle-market private equity firms

Structuring deals is much more of an art than a science. We ask management to contribute a portion of their proceeds into the new deal on the same terms as our investment. In addition, we award stock options to the management team when certain objectives are met. It is important to note that RLJ finances deals with a conservative level of debt in order to maximize the growth of your business

We exit when we feel we have maximized shareholder value and when the business has achieved certain objectives. A typical hold period can be anywhere from three to five years

Partnering with exceptional management teams to leverage experience and relationship to grow businesses that make a difference

Our firm seeks to identify and invest in high-quality companies led by motivated and skilled executives.

We then align both our short and long-term interests by providing our management teams with meaningful ownership stakes in the businesses they lead.

The opportunity to significantly improve profitability through revenue growth, consolidation of expenses or expense reductions, and add-on acquisitions leading to efficiencies of scale or other operating improvements

Prefer to acquire and expand companies in concert with existing management

Selectively pursue opportunities that require management transition

Healthcare represents an important market sector for us and Weiser provides us with additional tools to offer the associations in it,” Johnson concluded.

"This acquisition is a key step in the ongoing evolution of Naylor's platform of services," said Jerry Johnson, an RLJ partner and Chairman of Naylor.  "Naylor has a unique blend of services in SaaS, communications, events and management that enable them to super-serve the association market in a way no other single provider can. We're very excited about what Naylor and TechMedia can do together."

RLJ Equity Partners:

Jerry L. Johnson, 240-744-7887 or Otey Smith, 240-744-7893

Daphne J. Dufresne, 40 Managing director, RLJ Equity Partners

When Johnson interviewed Daphne Dufresne to head his newly formed private equity company in 2006, one thing stood out: her confidence.

“She said ‘I understand this private equity business, I know what it takes to raise money, find deals, evaluate and close deals.’ Daphne projected the confidence that I’m ready to take on the top role at a private equity firm ... and that impressed me,” Johnson said.

Not only was she a former principal at multibillion-dollar private equity firm Western Presidio Capital, but also an associate director in the structured finance group at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Europe.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s in engineering in 1994, but wanted to explore an interest in business and started out in consulting.

The Harvard Business School graduate said she understands she has to continually prove herself to establish credibility.

At RLJ Equity Partners, Dufresne oversees investments in five companies, including Fleishmann’s Vinegar in Cerritos, Calif., and tour operator CVC in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

T. Otey Smith, 35 Vice president, RLJ Equity Partners

After working as an analyst in the mergers and acquisitions Group at Goldman Sachs for two years straight out of college, T. Otey Smith was ready for a new challenge.

“Goldman let me figure out what I wanted to do with my life, which was to be in private equity. But I knew I wanted to work at a place where I could shape the environment, shape the culture,” he said.

So Smith high-tailed it to Chicago to become a founding member of Reliant Equity Investors, a middle market private equity fund with $120 million of assets under management today.

When Smith graduated in 2006, his former boss at Reliant recommended he reach out to Daphne Dufresne, who had just signed on at RLJ Equity Partners. They hit it off and she brought him on as one of the first three people at the company.

Trevoir Gregg, 38 Managing partner, RLJ Credit Opportunity Fund

Trevoir Gregg will tell you that his ascent to the upper echelon of asset management was a matter of “luck defined by preparation meeting opportunity.”

Right out of Morehouse College in 1995, Gregg landed a job as a credit analyst at TD Securities where he provided project financing for utility companies until moving on to handle acquisition funding at SG Cowen Securities two years later.

Gregg took time off in 2000 to complete an MBA at Harvard University, then jumped to General Electric Capital, where he underwrote nearly $2 billion in loans during his two-year stint.

He went on to become a founding member of Carlyle Mezzanine Partners, a $436 million fund at the D.C. buyout firm targeting middle-market companies. Gregg, then 30 years old, was one of the youngest team members.

Jesse Burwell, 35 Vice president of investorservices, RLJ Cos.

Throughout his 20s, Jesse Burwell seized one opportunity after another to further his career in accounting. There was a stint at Deloitte & Touche as a senior auditor, time at Wachovia Securities as an analyst in the loan syndications group. And by the time Burwell reached 29, he was comfortably employed as a senior accountant at one of the largest private equity firms in the country, the Carlyle Group.

“Jesse is a diligent and responsible worker. I noted these characteristics about him when we worked briefly together on a project while at the Carlyle Group,” Thomas said. “This is what encouraged me to reach out to bring him over to RLJ.”

“Being in on the ground floor has allowed me to progress a little bit faster than I would have at a traditional firm that had been around for 30 or 40 years,” he said. “I’ve been able to do things outside of my discipline and gain some good experience.”

Corey Printup, 30 Vice president, RLJ Fixed Income

Corey Printup was a 24-year-old investment banker in 2006 when Johnson plucked him from Morgan Stanley to work at RLJ Private Equity. At the time, he had arranged or managed more than $17 billion in securities at the global giant.

Printup was drawn to Johnson’s aim of “putting together young minority talent to have a ground-up opportunity at a private equity fund.”

“Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley will give you a solid foundation. At those type of shops your ideas will be heard, but you’re not going to have anything from the execution standpoint,” he said. “Where here, not only can you generate the ideas, but you’re also going to be given the leeway to execute them.”

Equity capital for this transaction will come from Carlyle Partners V (Carlyle’s flagship $13.7 billion U.S. buyout fund), Carlyle’s South America Buyout Fund, Mr. Paulus and other co-investors (including RLJ Equity Partners).

"RLJ Equity Partners is very excited to support Naylor Association Solutions' strategy to continue to expand the number of high quality products and services to its clients," said Jerry L. Johnson, Managing Director of RLJ Equity Partners.

URL: https://rljequitypartners.com/news_media&id=132 TITLE: RLJ Equity Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ There are no foosball tables in the break room at RLJ Cos., or any of the other trappings found at some firms with young leaders. But executives under 40 swell the senior ranks at the investment firm in Bethesda.. Nearly all 14 businesses that comprise RLJ Cos. has some fresh-faced employee on its management team, especially those entities tied to financial services. Young executives at RLJ, and at large in corporate America, are increasingly prized for their willingness to take risks and be innovative. These up-and-comers came of age in their careers amid economic uncertainty that some say has made them more fearless than their not-so-young counterparts. “We have hired some of the best and the brightest. And, on many occasions, they are young, aggressive people who are looking to work for a company where they can add value,” said Chairman Robert L. Johnson, who has started numerous ventures under RLJ since selling Black Entertainment Television to Viacom in 2001 for $3 billion. There is an “energy that they bring, an openness to new ideas, willingness to take risks and learn from them,” Johnson said. That can be especially true in industries such as financial services, where a proven ability to make money has long been a key to advancement, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, director of Harvard University’s Advanced Leadership Initiative. “Financial services, especially the sales and deal sides, have always favored high-energy younger managers, who tend to get rich fast, burn out and retire young,” she said. “Whether they all can be called leaders in the sense of setting long-term direction, creating new strategy ... is another question altogether.” Indeed, some wonder whether they have enough experience to navigate turns in the business cycle the way more seasoned professionals can. Still, John Challenger, chief executive of the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said he believes young professionals have a better chance of being groomed for the C-suite these days than prior to the downturn. “The enormous amount of downsizing during the recession and in the aftermath wiped out a whole generation of people in finance,” he said. As the economy rebounds, more companies are “filling that void with a whole new generation and that’s helping them keep down cost and develop talent.” That opportunity does not always flow equally. There remains a glaring disparity in the number of minorities represented in that new generation of leadership, said Mike Bush, president of The Minority Resource, a career coaching outfit. “People basically hire people they know. So it’s still a long slog for most minorities to get ahead,” he said. Johnson agrees that interpersonal relationships weigh heavily on hiring decisions in middle and senior management, leaving scores of talented minorities out in the cold. “The wealth of this nation should be managed in the same way that the wealth of this nation is created. A lot of the money that comes into these big funds comes from the 401ks and mutual fund investments of minority employees,” he said. “The Harvard graduates that populate RLJ are the same kind of people that could be working at some of these big Wall Street firms and investment houses.” Daphne J. Dufresne, 40 Managing director, RLJ Equity Partners When Johnson interviewed Daphne Dufresne to head his newly formed private equity company in 2006, one thing stood out: her confidence. “She said ‘I understand this private equity business, I know what it takes to raise money, find deals, evaluate and close deals.’ Daphne projected the confidence that I’m ready to take on the top role at a private equity firm ... and that impressed me,” Johnson said. Dufresne walked through the doors of RLJ with a long list of credentials. Not only was she a former principal at multibillion-dollar private equity firm Western Presidio Capital, but also an associate director in the structured finance group at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Europe. A career in finance, however, was not always on Dufresne’s agenda. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s in engineering in 1994, but wanted to explore an interest in business and started out in consulting. “I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, run a business. And private equity was just a great industry to take a quasi step towards that ... You are taking an ownership stake in a company and thinking about its growth strategically,” she said. The Harvard Business School graduate said she understands she has to continually prove herself to establish credibility. Dufresne recalls a client at Western Presidio who constantly compared her to his college-aged daughter. Though the association was initially off-putting, she used it to ingratiate herself with the client. “When his company was facing challenges, he felt comfortable calling me. I think he might have avoided making that call if he viewed me as this hard-charging person,” she said. At RLJ Equity Partners, Dufresne oversees investments in five companies, including Fleishmann’s Vinegar in Cerritos, Calif., and tour operator CVC in Sao Paulo, Brazil. T. Otey Smith, 35 Vice president, RLJ Equity Partners After working as an analyst in the mergers and acquisitions Group at Goldman Sachs for two years straight out of college, T. Otey Smith was ready for a new challenge. “Goldman let me figure out what I wanted to do with my life, which was to be in private equity. But I knew I wanted to work at a place where I could shape the environment, shape the culture,” he said. So Smith high-tailed it to Chicago to become a founding member of Reliant Equity Investors, a middle market private equity fund with $120 million of assets under management today. There, he helped raise capital and engineer transactions for two years as a senior associate before heading to Harvard Business School. When Smith graduated in 2006, his former boss at Reliant recommended he reach out to Daphne Dufresne, who had just signed on at RLJ Equity Partners. They hit it off and she brought him on as one of the first three people at the company. “You can’t underestimate how important it is to maintain relationships in this business. They take a long time to build, but, if nurtured, can help you along the way,” he said. Trevoir Gregg, 38 Managing partner, RLJ Credit Opportunity Fund Trevoir Gregg will tell you that his ascent to the upper echelon of asset management was a matter of “luck defined by preparation meeting opportunity.” Right out of Morehouse College in 1995, Gregg landed a job as a credit analyst at TD Securities where he provided project financing for utility companies until moving on to handle acquisition funding at SG Cowen Securities two years later. Gregg took time off in 2000 to complete an MBA at Harvard University, then jumped to General Electric Capital, where he underwrote nearly $2 billion in loans during his two-year stint. He went on to become a founding member of Carlyle Mezzanine Partners, a $436 million fund at the D.C. buyout firm targeting middle-market companies. Gregg, then 30 years old, was one of the youngest team members. There were some clients that looked at him askance. “As much as people will look for certain attributes that they believe denote success or quality, ultimately everybody can see how much money you took in, how well you managed it and how much value you delivered to your investors,” he said. “If you have a consistent track record, ultimately that trumps age, ethnicity and everything else.” After three years at Carlyle, Gregg moved on to becoming a principal at Allied Capital. When the company was sold in 2010, he was ready to “be the lead portfolio manager and directly develop a track record, really be seen as the point person, putting together a portfolio and standing behind the returns of that portfolio.” And Johnson offered him the chance to do just that as a co-founder of RLJ Credit Opportunity Fund, a division that provides financing to middle-market companies. Jesse Burwell, 35 Vice president of investorservices, RLJ Cos. Throughout his 20s, Jesse Burwell seized one opportunity after another to further his career in accounting. There was a stint at Deloitte & Touche as a senior auditor, time at Wachovia Securities as an analyst in the loan syndications group. And by the time Burwell reached 29, he was comfortably employed as a senior accountant at one of the largest private equity firms in the country, the Carlyle Group. But he wanted to explore other facets of finance. It just so happened that one of his former colleagues at Carlyle, Ernita Thomas, had just taken on the role of controller at RLJ Cos. and was hiring. “Jesse is a diligent and responsible worker. I noted these characteristics about him when we worked briefly together on a project while at the Carlyle Group,” Thomas said. “This is what encouraged me to reach out to bring him over to RLJ.” Burwell was intrigued by the chance to be a part of a new venture. “Being in on the ground floor has allowed me to progress a little bit faster than I would have at a traditional firm that had been around for 30 or 40 years,” he said. “I’ve been able to do things outside of my discipline and gain some good experience.” Corey Printup, 30 Vice president, RLJ Fixed Income Corey Printup was a 24-year-old investment banker in 2006 when Johnson plucked him from Morgan Stanley to work at RLJ Private Equity. At the time, he had arranged or managed more than $17 billion in securities at the global giant. Printup was drawn to Johnson’s aim of “putting together young minority talent to have a ground-up opportunity at a private equity fund.” At an age when most of his peers were holding onto the lower rungs of the corporate ladder, Printup was leading the creation of a $30 million enterprise fund to finance businesses in Liberia. He traveled back and forth to the West African country for five years during which time he oversaw the development of luxury lodging RLJ Kendeja Resort & Villas. After the project was up and running, Printup was tasked with taking charge of RLJ Fixed Income in January. The start-up focuses on fixed-income investments — whereby the maturity and interest payments are fixed —within government, corporate, federal agency and municipal bond markets. “Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley will give you a solid foundation. At those type of shops your ideas will be heard, but you’re not going to have anything from the execution standpoint,” he said. “Where here, not only can you generate the ideas, but you’re also going to be given the leeway to execute them.”

URL: https://rljequitypartners.com/news_media&id=133 TITLE: RLJ Equity Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ Sao Paulo, Brazil and New York, NY – Global private equity firm The Carlyle Group today announced that it has acquired CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. (CVC) from Founder and Chairman Guilherme Paulus. Mr. Paulus will remain Chairman of CVC and will retain a significant minority equity stake in the company. CVC is headquartered in Santo André (SP), Brazil and is the largest tour operator in Latin America. The transaction closed in late December 2009 and included the tour operator and the cruise ship businesses of CVC. The other companies controlled by Mr. Paulus – the airline WebJet, the hotel management company GJP and the advertising agency GP7 – were not included. Carlyle has acquired a 63.6 percent stake in CVC. Additional financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Founded in 1972 by Mr. Paulus, CVC packages charter and commercial flights, cruises, hotels and receptive services into vacation packages, which it sells to more than two million passengers per year. A broad assortment of tour packages to both domestic and international destinations are sold through more than 400 retail stores, which are mostly franchised, and through approximately 8,000 independent travel agents. CVC has more than 900 employees and generates more than 4,500 indirect jobs. CVC has benefited from Brazil’s favorable demographics, where the addressable market for tour packages has grown by approximately 25 million people over the past five years. CVC is well positioned to sell its affordable travel packages to Brazilian consumers, particularly given CVC’s ability to offer attractive payment terms and to assist first-time travelers with the nuances of air travel. Valter Patriani, Chief Executive Officer of CVC, said, “Many of Brazil’s consumers are just discovering that vacationing via airplane is an affordable alternative. CVC’s broad product offering and affordable pricing have opened up a new way of life for many consumers.” In the medium-term, CVC will continue focusing on the Brazilian market, already the 10th largest economy in the world with expected GDP growth of five percent in 2010. Brazil’s tourism sector is expected to benefit from increased travel demand and heavy infrastructure investments as the country prepares to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. In the long-term, CVC may seek to expand into other South American markets. Mr. Paulus said, “Carlyle’s financial expertise and global resources will serve the business well. We see a bright future for CVC as we continue to deliver attractively-priced tour packages to a rapidly-growing customer base.” Fernando Borges, Carlyle Managing Director and Head of Carlyle’s South America Buyouts team, said, “We are pleased to make our first buyout investment in Brazil. CVC is a top company led by a talented CEO, Valter Patriani, and his management team, who have an outstanding track record and a clear strategy for long-term growth. Carlyle’s Brazil team and its New York-based consumer and retail group will support CVC’s continued growth strategy, and we expect that CVC’s valued customers and talented employees will benefit as CVC continues to increase the breadth and value of its industry-leading tour package offerings.” Sandra Horbach, Carlyle Managing Director and Head of the Consumer & Retail team, said, “CVC is an outstanding business with a superb market position, exceptional brand loyalty and a fast-growing customer base. We are excited to partner with Founder and Chairman Guilherme Paulus to build a world-class brand in a region and sector with tremendous growth prospects.” CVC was advised by Mattos Filho. The Carlyle Group was advised by Pinheiro Neto, Debevoise & Plimpton and Rothschild. Equity capital for this transaction will come from Carlyle Partners V (Carlyle’s flagship $13.7 billion U.S. buyout fund), Carlyle’s South America Buyout Fund, Mr. Paulus and other co-investors (including RLJ Equity Partners). About CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A: CVC has been a key player in the Brazilian tourism sector for 37 years, having transported more than 15 million passengers to domestic and international destinations. Founded in Santo André (SP), Brazil, the company is the largest tour operator in Latin America. CVC transformed the Brazilian tourism industry by being the first tour operator to charter planes in Brazil, to sell tourism products via the retail channel, to offer customers installment payment plans and to make travel affordable for all consumer segments. Currently, CVC’s distribution network consists of more than 8,000 accredited independent travel agents and more than 400 exclusive stores nationwide. In 2009, CVC sold travel products to more than two million consumers, an increase of 20% over 2008. www.cvc.com.br

URL: https://rljequitypartners.com/news_media&id=44 TITLE: RLJ Equity Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ RLJ Equity Partners is finally putting money to work, though probably not exactly in the way founder Robert L. Johnson, the billionaire media mogul, envisioned when he set out more than four years ago to invest in media, financial services and business services industries. In its first platform investment, the mid-market buyout firm on Jan. 4 quietly paid about $90 million for Fleischmann’s Vinegar Co. Inc., the North American market-leading supplier of industrial-grade vinegar to H.J. Heinz Co. and other large food companies. RLJ Equity also made two minority investments the previous month, one of which the firm may build into a control stake. The Bethesda, Md.-based firm's story illustrates the challenges new firms face when they set out to build a team, do deals and raise money at the same time, even with backing from an iconic businessman and a bluechip global buyout firm. The Fleischmann’s deal came more than four years after Johnson, who sold the company he founded, Black Entertainment Television, to Viacom Inc. in 2001, and The Carlyle Group announced the creation of the firm as a partnership to share co-investment opportunities. One big reason for the long span from the team's founding to its first deal was the time needed to build out a senior management team. Johnson and Carlyle announced the formation of the firm in late 2005, and by the end of January 2006 Johnson had made his first two senior hires. One was Daphne Dufresne, a former venture partner at funds-of-funds Parish Capital Advisors, where she managed the direct investment and co-investment program. Dufresne had previously been a principal at Weston Presidio, a growth capital firm where she developed an expertise in the consumer industry as well as gained experience with deals in the business services, industrial and technology sectors. The other was Alan Nichols, who was formerly the CFO of BET and CFO of Chronicle Publishing Co., the owner of the San Francisco Chronicle. In early 2007, RLJ Equity added financing expertise to the firm by hiring Rufus Rivers from Carlyle Group, where he co-founded Carlyle Mezzanine Partners, a $436 million fund. While at Carlyle Group, Rivers worked on deals in a variety of industries, including consumer, industrial and business services. A setback came in June 2007 when, just as RLJ Equity was launching its debut fundraising effort, Nichols left the firm. He was living in San Francisco with his family and both he and other executives found the distance from the firm’s base in Maryland too straining as they sought deals and started fundraising. "We tried to have a satellite office but when you are just starting out as a new firm that is really hard," Dufresne said in an e-mail. "It required that he was on a plane to the East Coast a lot. For family reasons, a move to Maryland was not feasible for him." In March 2008, the firm rounded out the senior management team by hiring Kenneth Bryant, a former vice president at The Wicks Group of Companies. While at Wicks, primarily known as a mid-market media firm, Bryant focused on investments in education, publishing and business services. Altogether RLJ Equity has seven investment professionals, including Johnson, who also holds a majority interest in RLJ Development, a hotel real estate company, and two real estate investment funds. The firm has three vice presidents: Nigel Howard, a former vice president at TA Associates, the growth-oriented private equity firm, where he focused on investments in business services, financial services and consumer sectors; Jerry Johnson (no relation to Robert Johnson), a former vice president of corporate development at American Capital; and Otey Smith, a former senior associate and founding member of Reliant Equity Investors, a lower mid-market private equity firm that invests in manufacturing, business-to-business services and consumer products, according to CapitalIQ. Inevitably, the different backgrounds these managers brought to RLJ Equity led to refinements in the firm's investment strategy. Given Johnson’s background, media was expected to be RLJ Equity's bread-and-butter, but the firm has yet to do a deal in the industry. “We have reviewed a number of traditional media deals but many are plagued by extreme pressure on their advertising model and new media forms continually taking share so they haven’t been compelling investment opportunities,” Dufresne wrote in an e-mail. In light of Dufresne’s background, the firm added consumer products to its target sectors when she joined, while it dropped financial services about the same time. According to Dufresne, the firm wanted to avoid any conflicts of interest that might have arisen from RLJ Equity's parent company, RLJ Companies, buying a bank in March 2006. Besides, Dufresne and Nichols had little experience investing in financial services. The firm, which aims to make equity investments of $20 million to $45 million, continues to target media, consumer products and business services. But since early 2007 it has also targeted general industrial and transportation and logistics to capitalize on the experience of Dufresne and Rivers. These sectors, as well as aerospace and defense, also overlap with Carlyle Group's expertise. Just how much the changes in management and strategy had on raising money isn't exactly clear. Dufresne said Nichols's departure had no impact on the fundraising, launched in mid-2007. Most firms typically take 24 months to raise a first-time fund, she said, adding that, thanks to financial backing from Carlyle Group and Johnson, RLJ Equity could take its time building its team. "We were more concerned with building a firm than raising a fund," she wrote in an e-mail. "While prospective LPs wanted to know why he left the firm, they got very comfortable with our explanation of wanting the entire team in one office." Early press reports on the firm suggested the firm would try to raise as much as $500 million for its debut fund, but in recent interviews with Buyouts, executives said they in fact planned to target $400 million. As they refined their strategy, they scaled back the target to $300 million by the time they launched fundraising. After about two years, in June 2009, RLJ Equity closed the fund short of its target, at $230 million, with support from Parish Capital and the New York State Common Retirement Fund, among other investors. “We feel pretty good about raising $230 million in a difficult environment,” Rivers said. Johnson committed $15 million to $25 million of his own money to the fund, while Carlyle Group invested some $3 million to $5 million in equity for 20 percent of the firm’s general partnership. “Robert Johnson is very successful, and we like to associate with accomplished individuals and firms with whom we can partner on transactions, share deal flow with and benefit from each other’s success,” Chris Ullman, a managing director at Carlyle Group, told Buyouts in an interview for this article. Deal Time Although the firm had been looking for deals since 2006, Dufresne said it didn’t make any platform acquisitions until the Fleischmann’s deal this year in part because it had limited manpower to concentrate both on fundraising and deals. The firm had one deal near closing in 2008, but it fell apart when the credit markets collapsed. Dufresne said the firm also was unwilling to pay what its executives saw as inflated prices during those years. “Obviously you want to see things close, but in general when you look at a business and you think it's worth 6x and it traded for 8x, no one's feeling bad now having not done that transaction,” she said. In Fleischmann’s, RLJ Equity has landed a company with a 90-year heritage and a dominant position in the U.S. industrial-grade vinegar market: Fleischmann’s produces 55 percent of the vinegar that’s used in American food products, including such popular consumer brands as Heinz ketchup, French’s mustard and Ken’s salad dressings. The Cerritos, Calif.- based company also has a growing retail line of organic vinegars, including the standard red and white vinegars as well as apple cider vinegar and brown rice vinegar. The deal, which closed Jan. 4, was financed by Fleischmann’s existing lender, GE Antares Capital, at 4x EBITDA. Dufresne’s and Rivers’s longstanding relationships with the lead bankers at GE Antares—Katie Hockman, senior vice president, and David Brackett, senior managing director—helped the firm get the deal. Rivers worked with Brackett from 1988 through 1995 in the corporate finance group of Heller Financial, while over the two years leading up to the Fleischmann's deal, Hockman had looked at 25 to 30 deals with Dufresne. “This is a group we’ve been targeting to try to do deals with,” Brackett told Buyouts. “When you have an industry name like Robert L. Johnson come into the private equity field, that’s an individual we want to partner with.” Brackett said he was impressed with the team’s discipline, adding that the time it took RLJ Equity to land its first platform investment is to be expected. “Looking at opportunities with them over the last two years, you get to see that they know what they’re doing, they know what their strike zone is,” Brackett said. “If instead you find with a new sponsor relationship that you’re constantly struggling about whether the sponsor wants to do the deal, or if we feel that we’re being dragged by a sponsor over the finish line, then it becomes clear you're not on the same page regarding the type of deals you want to pursue. That certainly has not been the case with RLJ.” The firm’s relationship with Carlyle also paid off in the two minority investments it made in December. Carlyle invited RLJ Equity as a minority investor in its buyout of CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A., a Santo Andre, Brazil-based company that runs tours in Latin America. And Spell Capital Partners, a Minneapolis, Minn.-based private equity firm that targets small businesses, invited RLJ Equity as a minority investor in LAI International Inc., a Westminster, Md.-based company that makes components used in aircraft engines, power generators and defense systems. Spell Capital, which bought the company in 2005, wanted to generate some liquidity for its investors, but still wanted to pursue growth initiatives to push LAI’s products into new industries, such as medical devices. RLJ Equity’s relationship with Carlyle, a longtime investor in aerospace and defense and health care, helped close the deal, Dobson West, a senior managing director at Spell Capital, told Buyouts. Spell Capital will fully exit the company in the next few years, likely through another deal with RLJ Equity. “Since they’re already there and know the company they would seem to be a logical buyer,” West said. RLJ Equity began life at the top of the buyout market, when institutional investors were scrambling to increase their investments in private equity and financing for deals was cheap and easy. But not having a complete team or final strategy in place from the start seems to have lengthened the firm's path to its first two deals this December—not to mention a challenging market in which to raise a fund and do deals. That said, RLJ Equity executives feel they’re well positioned considering they didn’t overpay for companies during the buyout boom of 2006 to 2007. “I think our timing is quite good,” Dufresne said. “Had we had a Fund I or II and were on Fund III, we’d probably have some portfolio issues. We’re un-encumbered, and we have fresh capital and a hungry team.”

Johnson, founder and chairman of The RLJ Companies today expressed his concerns about proposed legislation that, if enacted, will more than double the taxes and pose a direct threat to the economic viability of minority private equity firms. “In my opinion, this legislation would cause a rapid decline in minority private equity firms and possibly eliminate minority participation in this important financial sector of the American economy. Minority firms have difficult challenges in attracting fund investors and an even more difficult time attracting top managerial talent. If this legislation is approved, it will become even more daunting for minority firms. Historically, minority firms generate less investment capital than major firms, require more time to raise funds compared to larger firms, and, as a consequence, if taxes are raised on minority companies the same as it exists for large firms, talented minority men and women would likely choose to stay at their existing firms. Furthermore, if minority firms can’t hire the best and the brightest, corporate and union pension funds that are already skeptical of the effectiveness of minority private equity funds would likely decrease their investment in these funds due to the lack of “experienced and talented fund managers. For the most part, minority firms invest their funds in minority businesses and other businesses located in urban communities. If minority funds are reduced or eliminated it will also impact investments in urban cities and job creation and economic development in markets where it is most needed. To enact the proposed legislation would be devastating to a minority private equity firms across the country, undermining current efforts to rebuild and grow our economy putting the financial climate further at risk.” About The RLJ Companies: The RLJ Companies, founded by Robert L.

URL: https://rljequitypartners.com/news_media&id=47 TITLE: RLJ Equity Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ With an exploding national debt and burgeoning budget deficits, Congress is singularly focused on raising revenue. But in their rush to plug the hole in America’s budget, policymakers cannot lose sight of a simple fact: It would be disastrous long-term fiscal policy to create permanent roadblocks to economic growth, especially for the nation’s minority communities and entrepreneurs, as a short-term fix for today’s exuberant spending. Perhaps the prime example of this short-sighted approach is Congress’ attempt to impose a tax hike of more than 150 percent on the profits earned by venture capital, real estate, private equity and other private investment partnerships – partnerships that together have made a significant contribution in recent decades to job creation and America’s economic growth. This move is seen by many as a “soak-the-rich” tax on wealthy investment managers on Wall Street. But the fact is these investment partnerships are crucial engines of economic growth for Main Street. There are literally hundreds of these partnerships in America – most of them small – working and investing in every state. They are especially important in minority and underserved communities that are often cut off from traditional sources of capital. Think for a second about how America will grow and proposer in the coming decades. According to census data, groups that historically have been considered ethnic minorities in this country — principally African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans — are expected to account for more than 50 percent of children under the age of 18 by as early as 2023 and a majority of working-age Americans by 2039. This emerging class of executives, managers and workers represents the future and the hope for America. Unless we encourage investment today in the businesses that employ them and the communities that nurture them, our future will be that much less bright. A recent study conducted by the National Association of Investment Companies (NAIC), which represents minority-owned and managed private equity firms and those who invest in ethnically diverse communities, found that private capital investment can play a critical role in promoting job growth, higher wages, better benefits and overall economic development in the nation's growing minority communities. The study of seven NAIC investments found, on average, annual job growth after private capital investment was 14 percent, compared to 1 percent for all U.S. non-farm jobs between 2003 and 2008. Two-thirds of those new jobs went to minorities, compared to the overall U.S. minority employment rate of 30 percent. Revenue at the emerging market companies receiving private equity investments grew at an average annual rate of 35 percent, compared to a 5 percent rate for all U.S. businesses. But we don’t need studies to prove that capital investment in minority businesses can transform companies, employees and whole communities. I’ve spent a lifetime investing in these communities and I’ve seen the firsthand how private investment can strengthen minority-owned companies and enrich the lives of employees and families in underserved communities. And I know that lifting up these communities provides a foundation and a model for the rest of the country. As America’s demographics shift and its workforce becomes much more diverse, we cannot afford to move backwards in our effort to create economic opportunities for a new generation. But that’s exactly where we’d be headed if Congress raises taxes on private investment partnerships. Make no mistake: Despite claims by policymakers and others that raising taxes on so-called “carried interest” will only affect a small group of wealthy fund managers, the real impact will be felt by workers and small business owners on Main Street who desperately need access to private capital to survive, prosper and grow. Mr. Johnson is the founder and chairman of The RLJ Companies, an innovative business network that provides strategic investments in a diverse portfolio of companies. He is also CEO and co-founder of RLJ Development, LLC a privately-held real estate investment company that primarily owns upscale select service and compact full service hotels in major markets in North America; and chairman of RLJ Equity Partners, LLC, a private equity firm founded in partnership with The Carlyle Group, and specializes in middle-market leveraged buyouts, leveraged recapitalizations, and growth equity.

URL: https://rljequitypartners.com/news_media&id=60 TITLE: RLJ Equity Partners BASE CONTENT: ================================================================================ RIO DE JANEIRO--Brazilian travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora e Agencia de Viagens SA raised a smaller amount than expected in its initial public offering late Thursday, pricing shares below the range established when the deal was announced last month. CVC, as Brazil's largest travel agency group by revenue is also known, raised 621 million Brazilian reais ($263 million). The company sold 38.8 million shares priced at BRL16.00 per share, down from an expected range of between BRL18.00 and BRL22.00. The company had initially expected to raise as much as BRL1 billion from the share sale. Brazil has experienced a surge in travel in recent years as low unemployment, higher wages and greater access to consumer credit allowed Brazilians to take trips in growing numbers. But CVC's lower-than-expected IPO reflects concerns about future growth prospects in Brazil, where high inflation and recent interest-rate increases could undercut domestic consumption. Latin America's largest economy posted its worst performance since 2009 in the third quarter, when the economy shrank 0.5%. CVC had originally filed to hold the IPO at the start of 2012, but the offer was postponed because of adverse market conditions. Prospects have improved only slightly since as expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve could start tapering its bond-buying program has sapped momentum from emerging markets, such as Brazil. CVC is controlled by private-equity firm Carlyle Group, which has a 63.6% stake in the company. The travel agency's founder, Guilherme Paulus, holds the remaining stake. Carlyle, via its investment vehicle called BTC Fundo de Investimentos em Participacoes, had said that it would sell at least 21.5 million shares via the IPO. The company posted a net revenue of BRL623.4 million in 2012, compared with BRL596 million in 2011, and reported a net profit of BRL20 million last year, down from BRL110 million the year prior. CVC will list its shares on the Novo Mercado market, which is the country's most rigorous in terms of corporate governance. To qualify, a company must sell at least 25% of its shares to the public, and all of its shares must be ordinary rather than preferred shares. The shares, listed under the ticker symbol CVCB3, will start trading Monday on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. Itau BBA, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BTG Pactual and J.P. Morgan handled the deal.

(August 7, 2014) – Naylor, LLC, which recently acquired association career solutions provider Boxwood Technology, today launched a new brand platform which better reflects the broader “Associations Solutions” and integrated offerings Naylor has launched and acquired over the last three years and provides to 1,500 associations in North America. Naylor will now go by the name Naylor Association Solutions, which will be depicted in a new logo (see above) and an entirely new branding platform. “This is an exciting step for Naylor, “said Alex DeBarr, CEO of Naylor since 2006. “The new brand and logo are really a culmination of great work by our teams, the acquisition of Global Exchange Events and recently Boxwood, and our partnership with RLJ Equity Partners. It signals a new phase in the growth and development of our ability to help our associations succeed and build relevance.” Naylor, founded over 40 years ago in Canada, has been a leader in providing Print media and non-dues revenue solutions for many years.

Naylor sees direct linkage between strong communication tools via print and digital media, strong event management, comprehensive job and career services, member research and marketing—and association success in generating non-dues revenue and developing strong member engagement. Done right, stronger engagement can also build dues revenue and added membership. “The new branding reflects the evolution of our company into a fully integrated association solutions provider,” said Alex DeBarr, Naylor CEO since 2006. “Associations are now seeing how important member engagement is to their survival and success, and non-dues revenue has always been vital to them. We are simply tracking and responding to the needs of associations by talking to them and surveying them frequently. We view our product offerings as an association’s tools of engagement.” DeBarr added, “The brand refresh and our focus on developing solutions for association challenges are also a reflection of our enthusiasm for using innovation and hard work to help associations succeed in their mission. The branding should make what we do at Naylor clear to anyone, today and in the future. We exist to help associations and their members and sponsors.” To celebrate the new platform, Naylor will unveil a new logo and look at the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) Annual Meeting & Exposition in Nashville during August 9-12, 2014.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Founded in 2011 by Nate Lipton and Paul Lipton, Growers House is based in Tucson, Arizona and has rapidly grown to become a leading digitally native, omni-channel hydroponic equipment and supplies retailer servicing the specialty agriculture industry. Nate and Angela Kapp serve as Co-CEOs. Growers House and its subsidiaries combine the creation of proprietary, industry leading video content with one of the largest assortments and seasoned cultivation experts to provide fullservice retail and consulting to commercial and hobbyist growers alike. The recapitalization retains founder Nate Lipton and the company’s management team and will provide the necessary capital to accelerate its omni-channel growth, develop more world class content for its rapidly expanding base, expand into new markets and offer best-in-class services and products to B2B and B2C customers. Managing Partner of RLJ Equity Partners Rufus Rivers said, “Nate has been at the forefront of this exciting industry for years. We look forward to using all of our resources at RLJ to help the company grow.” In addition to the continued development of the hydro industry’s leading e-commerce platform, GH will solidify its market leading business in Arizona with the addition of a second retail store, this one in Phoenix and begin serving international customers on its site. “We are excited to partner with RLJ Equity and Cave Creek Capital. They are seasoned investors who understand our digitally led omni-channel strategy but also the compelling nature of the content brands we’ve created, such as Canna Cribs, which highlight and define the future of cultivation products and methodologies,” said Co-Founder & Co-Chief Executive Officer at Growers House, Nate Lipton. Lipton also shared that the company plans to use many of the deep connections it has made in the industry with pre-eminent growers and cultivation facilities to R&D innovative products and bring them to market. “Helping supply the best and largest growers in the world along with our hands-on knowledge of visiting these facilities gives our team unique experiential knowledge that has taken us a decade to build,” says Lipton. RLJ provided the controlling equity for the transaction. DLA Piper LLP and Thompson Coburn LLP served as legal advisors. The Westbury Group acted as the financial advisor to Growers House.
